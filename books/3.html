  <h2 class="c005">PREFACE TO FOURTH REVISED EDITION, 1913.</h2>
</div>

<p class="c006">This edition is practically that of 1908, with necessary minor
revisions and corrections, especially the data referring to indices
of refraction and strength of double refraction. The values of
the refractive indices α and γ are recorded as well as the mean
values. References are also given to “The Methods of Petrographic-Microscopic
Research,” by F. E. Wright, 1912, for exact
(quantitative) methods of determining crystal constants.</p>

</div>

<p class="c006">The 1908 edition is essentially the same as that of 1905; the
only changes being in the nature of corrections, and the addition
of a brief description of the Schrœder van der Kolk method of
determining refractive indices and also an abbreviated diagram
for determining triclinic feldspars in sections showing both Carlsbad
and Albite twinning. The Naumann symbols for crystal
forms have also been omitted.</p>

  <h2 class="c005">PREFACE TO REVISED EDITION, 1905.</h2>
</div>

<p class="c006">In preparing the revised edition, Chapters I. and IV. have been
rewritten and enlarged and the part relating to the determination of
the plagioclases has been greatly amplified. Many additions have
also been made to Chapter III. and the Becke method, for the
determination of the relative indices of refraction of minerals, has
been given in detail.</p>

<p class="c007">Some new and useful tables have been introduced; as tables of
refractive indices (mean) and double refraction (maximum). A
diagram has also been added, showing the relation existing between
strength of double refraction, interference colors and thickness
of section.</p>

<p class="c007">Professor E. Weinschenk’s admirable text-book, “<span lang="de">Die Gesteinsbildenden
Mineralien</span>”, Freiburg, 1901, has been specially referred
to, and the tables of refractive indices and double refraction have
been compiled from Weinschenk’s new Tables.</p>

<p class="c007">Many new cuts have been added, among them being semi-ideal
drawings, showing typical outlines of crystal sections, cleavage,
optical orientation, etc. In describing the “Usual Appearance in
Sections” of a mineral, it is of course only possible to mention the
usual crystal form in which the mineral occurs in a rock. The
crystal may be cut in any way by the plane of the section; but a
general knowledge of the crystal forms will furnish an idea as to
the outline, etc., that the mineral may show in the section.</p>

</div>

<p class="c006">The identification of minerals in rock sections with the microscope,
including as it does a knowledge of optical mineralogy, is
often difficult for beginners. This may be due to the fact that
most of the publications on this subject are quite elaborate in their
nature and in either French or German. While detailed descriptions
<span class="pageno" id="Page_v">v</span>are very necessary, and, in fact, indispensable for advanced
investigation, they are apt to prove cumbersome and confusing at
first. For these reasons this text-book has been prepared by the
writer, with a view of putting before the student only those facts
which are absolutely necessary for the proper recognition and
identification of the common minerals in rock sections. The footnotes
refer the student to standard publications, in which are given
details of the methods and investigations outlined in the text. An
elementary knowledge of crystallography and mineralogy is almost
indispensable and is here assumed.</p>

<p class="c007">The microscopic and optical characters of the minerals are recorded
in the usual order in which they would be observed with a
petrographical microscope. Nearly all the rock-forming minerals
become transparent in thin sections; but when opaque, attention
is called to the fact and the characters are recorded as seen with
incident light. White light is assumed to be used, unless otherwise
stated. The interference colors recorded in all cases are
those given by very thin sections of 0.03 mm. in thickness.</p>

<p class="c007">The order followed for the minerals is essentially that of Rosenbusch
(based on the symmetry of the crystalline form), with a few
exceptions made for convenience, such as placing pyrrhotite after
pyrite and zoisite after epidote. The statements regarding the
occurrences of minerals in the common rock-types have been taken
mainly from Les Minéraux des Roches, by Lévy and Lacroix.</p>

<p class="c007">The terms axes and directions of elasticity, used throughout
this book, are very commonly employed in petrographical literature
of the present time. These axes and directions should probably
more correctly be called axes and directions of vibration or
extinction. The reasons for or against the elastic condition of the
“ether” are of more interest, however, to the physicist than to the
petrographer.</p>

<p class="c007">An optical scheme is appended, with the minerals grouped according
to their common optical characters.</p>

<p class="c007">The writer’s thanks are due to Dr. A. J. Moses, Professor of
Mineralogy, and to Mr. J. F. Kemp, Professor of Geology, for
kind suggestions offered during the preparation of this book.</p>

</div>

<p class="c006">The object of this introduction is merely to give a practical discussion
of elementary optics, as applied to optical mineralogy,<a id="r3"></a><a class="c011 pginternal" href="#f3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>
and no elaborate discussion of this important subject will be attempted.
The explanations will be made as simple as possible,
and, in most cases, only the optical phenomena will be described
without entering into a theoretical discussion as to the cause of
these phenomena.</p>

<p class="c007"><em>Light</em><a id="r4"></a><a class="c011 pginternal" href="#f4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> may be regarded as transmitted in straight lines by vibrations
of the “ether,” taking place at right angles to the direction of
transmission.</p>

<p class="c007"><em>Ordinary light</em> is light with the ether vibrations in all possible
directions, the path described by any particle of ether constantly
changing.</p>

<p class="c007"><em>Plane polarized light</em> is simply light with the ether vibrations all
<em>parallel</em> to one plane passing through the direction of transmission.</p>

<p class="c007">By experiment it has been proved that there exists a very close
relation between the optical properties of crystals and their other
physical properties, such as form, color, transmission of heat, etc.
Therefore it is often possible, by a careful optical investigation of
<span class="pageno" id="Page_2">2</span>a crystal section, to determine important crystallographic facts,
even in the absence of any distinct outline.</p>

<h3 class="c013">The Effects Produced by Crystals on Transmitted Light.</h3>

<p class="c014">Consider that a series of optical tests are made on all possible
sections<a id="r5"></a><a class="c011 pginternal" href="#f5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> of crystals in the six systems, and the manner in which
these crystals affect transmitted light ascertained.</p>

<p class="c007"><strong>Isotropic Crystals</strong>: It will be found that all sections of <em>Isometric</em>
crystals transmit light with equal velocity in all directions; that is,
the crystals are optically equivalent in all directions and, hence, can
produce no double refraction.<a id="r6"></a><a class="c011 pginternal" href="#f6"><sup>[6]</sup></a> In these crystals any section, however
cut, will transmit all the rays of light, incident to the surface at
right angles, with no change.<a id="r7"></a><a class="c011 pginternal" href="#f7"><sup>[7]</sup></a> The same is true of <em>Amorphous</em>
bodies, glass, etc., unless they have been subjected to strains or peculiar
conditions during cooling. A <em>single image</em> is seen through
these isotropic sections.</p>

<div class="figright id002">
<img alt="" class="ig001" src="images/image002.jpg" id="img_images_image002.jpg">
<div class="ic002">
<p><span class="sc">Fig. 1.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="c007"><strong>Anisotropic Crystals</strong>: It will also be found that nearly all sections
(the exceptions being given later) of crystals in the remaining
five systems, produce quite a different effect on transmitted light.
In these crystals the velocity of transmission of light varies with
the <em>vibration direction</em> of the light rays. This property, called
<em>double refraction</em>,<a id="r8"></a><a class="c011 pginternal" href="#f8"><sup>[8]</sup></a> seems to result from the power of resolving a
ray of ordinary light, with ether vibrations
in all directions, into two rays with
ether vibrations in planes at right angles
to each other; the two resulting rays traversing,
usually, divergent paths in passing
through the section.</p>

<p class="c007">The mineral calcite (Iceland spar)
exhibits this property to a marked degree,
and in certain sections will show a <em>double image</em>, Fig. 1.
That the vibration directions of the two doubly refracted rays are
<span class="pageno" id="Page_3">3</span>in planes at right angles to each other, can be easily proved by using
a nicol prism.<a id="r9"></a><a class="c011 pginternal" href="#f9"><sup>[9]</sup></a> In most cases the separation of the two images is so
slight as not to be perceived by the eye, and the practical method
of testing a crystal section for double refraction will be given
later, p. <a href="#Page_27" class="pginternal">27</a>.</p>

<p class="c007">The crystals that show double refraction are further divided into
two groups, <em>uniaxial</em> and <em>biaxial</em>:</p>

<p class="c007">(1) <strong>Uniaxial</strong>, or those in which the optical characters are symmetrical
to <em>one</em> direction, called an optic axis. This <em>optic axis</em> is
the crystallographic vertical axis, <em>ć</em>; and parallel to this direction
there is a single value only for the light velocity and no double
refraction takes place.<a id="r10"></a><a class="c011 pginternal" href="#f10"><sup>[10]</sup></a> Hence any section parallel to the base
(001) being at right angles to the optic axis, acts like a section
of an isotropic crystal and transmits all the perpendicularly incident
rays of light with no change. In any other section double
refraction takes place and it can be proved by using a nicol prism
that the two rays have ether vibrations, one in the plane passing
through the incident ray and the <em>ć</em> axis of the crystal, and the
other in a plane at right angles thereto, hence in the basal plane.
This latter ray, which has a constant velocity, is called the <em>ordinary
ray O</em>; and the other ray, with velocity varying with the
inclination of the section to <em>ć</em>, is called the <em>extraordinary ray
E</em>.<a id="r11"></a><a class="c011 pginternal" href="#f11"><sup>[11]</sup></a></p>

<p class="c007">The vibration directions are either parallel or symmetrical to
cleavage cracks and crystal outlines. In sections parallel to the
optic axis, the two doubly refracted rays have the maximum difference
in velocity of transmission, and hence their vibration directions
are called <em>principal vibration directions</em><a id="r12"></a><a class="c011 pginternal" href="#f12"><sup>[12]</sup></a> and the plane containing
them an <em>optical principal section</em>. In these sections the
refractive index of the ray vibrating parallel to <em>ć</em> (extraordinary
<span class="pageno" id="Page_4">4</span>ray) is denoted by ε, and that of the ray vibrating parallel to the
basal plane (ordinary ray) by ω.<a id="r13"></a><a class="c011 pginternal" href="#f13"><sup>[13]</sup></a></p>

<p class="c007">To this group belong all <em>Tetragonal</em> and <em>Hexagonal</em> crystals.</p>

<p class="c007">(2) <strong>Biaxial</strong>, or those in which the optical characters are no
longer symmetrical to an optic axis but to three planes at right
angles to each other (for monochromatic light). These crystals
have, however (for light of each wave-length and for each temperature),
<em>two</em> directions parallel to which there is a single value only
for the light velocity and hence no double refraction. These directions
are called “<em>optic axes</em>.”<a id="r14"></a><a class="c011 pginternal" href="#f14"><sup>[14]</sup></a> An investigation of these biaxial
crystals shows that of all the rays traversing these crystals there
are three rays which advance with maximum, minimum and some
intermediate velocity. The vibration directions of these three rays
are called the <em>principal vibration directions</em> and are at right angles
to each other (being the intersections of the three planes above
referred to). The direction of ether vibration of the fastest ray is
denoted by <span class="blackletter">a</span>, of the slowest ray by <span class="blackletter">c</span>, and of the ray advancing
with intermediate velocity by <span class="blackletter">b</span>.<a id="r15"></a><a class="c011 pginternal" href="#f15"><sup>[15]</sup></a> Each of the three planes, containing
two principal vibration directions, is called an <em>optical principal
section</em>. The index of refraction of the <span class="blackletter">a</span> ray is denoted by α,
of the <span class="blackletter">b</span> ray by β, and of the <span class="blackletter">c</span> ray by γ.</p>

<p class="c007">To this group belong all crystals in the <em>Orthorhombic</em>, <em>Monoclinic</em>
and <em>Triclinic</em> systems.</p>

<p class="c007">In the <em>Orthorhombic</em> system, the principal vibration directions
are parallel to the crystallographic axes; hence all pinacoidal sections
contain two of these principal vibration directions. In all
sections parallel to the three crystallographic axes <em>ă</em>, <em>ƃ</em> and <em>ć</em>, the
vibration directions are parallel or symmetrical to cleavage cracks,
crystal edges, etc.</p>

<p class="c007"><span class="pageno" id="Page_5">5</span>In the <em>Monoclinic</em> system, one principal vibration direction is
parallel to the ortho axis <em>ƃ</em>, the other principal vibration directions
are in the plane of symmetry, at right angles to <em>ƃ</em>, but are
not parallel with either the vertical axis <em>ć</em> or the clino axis <em>á</em>. In
clino pinacoid (010) sections the principal vibration directions
will make definite angles with crystallographic lines, such as
cleavages or crystal outlines. These angles are called <em>extinction
angles</em>. They will vary, in this system, with reference to the
direction of the <em>ć</em> axis from a maximum on the clino pinacoid (010)
to 0° on the ortho pinacoid (100), when the vibration directions of
the two doubly refracted rays will be parallel and at right angles to
the plane of symmetry. Hence the vibration directions are parallel
or symmetrical to cleavages, edges, etc., <em>only</em> in sections parallel to
the ortho axis <em>ƃ</em>; but in all other sections are unsymmetrical.</p>

<p class="c007">In the <em>Triclinic</em> system, the principal vibration directions are not
parallel to the crystallographic axes, and there is no definite relation
between these directions and the crystallographic axes; hence in
all possible sections there will be extinction angles.</p>

<p class="c007">In all biaxial crystals the two <em>optic axes</em> are inclined to each
other, making what is called the <em>axial angle, 2V</em>, the apparent
angle measured in air being <em>2E</em>. The optic axes lie in the plane,
called the <em>axial plane</em>, which contains the principal vibration directions
<span class="blackletter">a</span> and <span class="blackletter">c</span>. The axial angles are bisected by these principal
vibration directions, the direction bisecting the acute angle being
called the <em>acute bisectrix, Bx<sub>a</sub></em>, and that bisecting the obtuse angle
the <em>obtuse bisectrix, Bx<sub>o</sub></em>. An approximate idea of the value of the
axial angle can be obtained by the use of the petrographical microscope,
as described later, p. <a href="#Page_47" class="pginternal">47</a>. The axial angle is often a convenient
distinction between such minerals as muscovite and biotite.</p>

<p class="c007">The axial angle will vary with the temperature and with light of
different wave-length or color, and this variation is called <em>dispersion</em>
of the optic axes. Dispersion of the principal vibration directions
also takes place in monoclinic and triclinic crystals, but can be
usually disregarded.</p>

<p class="c007">In closing it is very important to remember that any section of
an anisotropic crystal (not at right angles to an optic axis) will
always transmit two rays of light with different velocities and with
vibration directions in planes at right angles to each other. Isometric
crystals, of course, produce no double refraction of light.</p>

</div>

<p class="c006">The <em>petrographical microscope</em> is essentially an ordinary microscope<a id="r17"></a><a class="c011 pginternal" href="#f17"><sup>[17]</sup></a>
with the following important additional equipment. It
must be provided with: 1° a <em>polarizer</em> (a piece of apparatus for
giving polarized light) placed below the stage; 2° an <em>analyzer</em> (a
piece of apparatus for analyzing the rays of light after they have
passed through the polarizer and transparent section) placed between
the objective and the eye; 3° a <em>stage rotating</em> about an axis
which is the line of sight of the microscope. A convenient type of
microscope is that made by Seibert of Wetzlar (No. 11 <em>a</em>), Fig. 2.</p>

<p class="c007">The reflector <em>a</em> is usually fitted with a plane mirror on one side,
and a parabolic mirror on the other. The plane mirror should be
used with sunlight, and the parabolic mirror with artificial light, in
order to make the rays of light as nearly parallel as possible.</p>

<p class="c007">The <em>polarizer</em> is in most cases a nicol prism, set in a suitable
frame <em>b</em>, and made as follows:</p>

<p class="c007">For the <em>nicol prism</em> “a cleavage rhombohedron of calcite (the
variety Iceland spar is universally used in consequence of its transparency)
is obtained, having four large and two small rhombohedral
faces opposite each other. In place of the latter planes,
two new surfaces are cut, making angles of 68° (instead of 71°)
with the obtuse vertical edges; these then form the terminal faces
of the prism. In addition to this, the prism is cut through in the
direction HH′, Fig. 3, the parts then polished and cemented together
again with Canada balsam. A ray of light, <em>ab</em>, entering the
prism, is divided into two rays polarized at right angles to each
other. One of these, <em>bc</em>, on meeting the layer of balsam (whose
refractive index is less than that of the ray <em>bc</em>), suffers total reflection,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_8">8</span>and is deflected against the blackened sides of the prism and
extinguished. The other, <em>bd</em>, passes through and emerges at <em>e</em>, a
completely polarized ray of light, that is, a ray with vibrations in
one direction only, and that the direction of the
shorter diagonal of the prism.”<a id="r18"></a><a class="c011 pginternal" href="#f18"><sup>[18]</sup></a> The vertical
plane through the shorter diagonal may be called
the <em>plane</em> of <em>vibration</em><a id="r19"></a><a class="c011 pginternal" href="#f19"><sup>[19]</sup></a> of the nicol.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class="c007">The polarizer must be below the stage <em>c</em>, and
is generally adjusted so as to have its plane
of vibration parallel to the N. and S. cross-wire
in the eye-piece <em>o</em>. It is important to
know the direction of the plane of vibration
of the polarizer or lower nicol, as we can
then determine, when absorption of light occurs
in a mineral, the direction in this mineral
parallel to which the absorbed rays are vibrating.
The polarizer slides in an outer shell
or frame, and, by means of a lever <em>d</em>, can easily
be raised or lowered.</p>

<p class="c007">A convenient test for the location of this
plane of vibration of the polarizer is as follows:
Make use of a section of biotite, cut at
right angles to the basal plane, hence showing the basal cleavage
cracks. Biotite has the property of absorbing to a marked extent
the light vibrating parallel to these cleavage cracks. Rotate such a
section on the stage of the microscope until the position of maximum
darkness is reached and when such is the case the plane of vibration
of the polarizer must be parallel to these cleavage cracks.</p>

<p class="c007">On the top of the nicol is placed the <em>condensing lens</em> for getting
<em>convergent</em> light, and the adjustments are so arranged that when
the nicol is up as far as it will go, the condensing lens<a id="r20"></a><a class="c011 pginternal" href="#f20"><sup>[20]</sup></a> is brought
almost in contact with the lower surface of the transparent section
resting on the stage.</p>

<p class="c007"><span class="pageno" id="Page_10">10</span>The <em>rotating</em> circular <em>stage e</em> is supported on a suitable frame <em>c</em>,
and arranged so that its axis of rotation coincides with the line of
sight of the microscope. The stage is graduated, and, by means
of an index fixed to the frame, the angular rotation can always be
obtained. It is also provided with two adjusting screws<a id="r21"></a><a class="c011 pginternal" href="#f21"><sup>[21]</sup></a> <em>f</em>, by
means of which the axis of rotation can be accurately centered.</p>

<p class="c007">The method of centering is as follows: Bring some prominent
mark in the section exactly in coincidence with the intersection of
the cross-wires in the eye-piece. Rotate the stage 180°, and correct
one half the error by means of the centering screws, and the
other half by moving the section on the stage. Check the result
by rotating the stage 180° again, and if necessary repeat the corrections
in the same way until the adjustment is satisfactory.</p>

<p class="c007">The <em>objective</em><a id="r22"></a><a class="c011 pginternal" href="#f22"><sup>[22]</sup></a> <em>g</em> screws into the collar <em>h</em>, which has a slot <em>k</em>, in
the upper portion, for the introduction of a sensitive color plate,
a one quarter undulation mica plate or a quartz wedge.<a id="r23"></a><a class="c011 pginternal" href="#f23"><sup>[23]</sup></a></p>

<p class="c007">The slot <em>k</em> is so arranged that, when the sensitive color plates
are introduced, the vibration directions of these plates will make
an angle of 45° with the planes of vibration of the crossed nicols,
and the interference color will thus be at its maximum intensity.</p>

<p class="c007">A revolving <em>nose-piece</em> is sometimes used which can be attached
to the collar <em>h</em> and arranged to carry two or three objectives, which
can thus be very quickly brought into position for use. This is
convenient in passing rapidly from observations with parallel light
to observations with convergent light, which must be made with a
high power objective. The difficulty is that recentering is generally
required. The modern microscopes are provided with a clip for
holding the objectives, instead of the screw-thread collar <em>h</em>.</p>

<p class="c007">The <em>analyzer</em><a id="r24"></a><a class="c011 pginternal" href="#f24"><sup>[24]</sup></a> or upper nicol is contained in the frame <em>l</em>, which
<span class="pageno" id="Page_11">11</span>is arranged so as to slide in and out of the tube of the microscope.</p>

<p class="c007">The plane of vibration of the analyzer is fixed by the instrument
maker so as to be at right angles to the plane of vibration of the
polarizer, hence in the Seibert microscope parallel to the E. and
W. cross-wire in the eye-piece. Consequently when the frame <em>l</em>
is pushed into the tube, the analyzer is introduced in the line of
sight between the objective and the observer’s eye, with its plane of
vibration at right angles to the plane of vibration of the polarizer;
that is the nicols are crossed. When the nicols are crossed, if they
are properly adjusted, no light can pass through to the eye and
the field of view should be dark.<a id="r25"></a><a class="c011 pginternal" href="#f25"><sup>[25]</sup></a></p>

<p class="c007">The <em>eye-piece</em><a id="r26"></a><a class="c011 pginternal" href="#f26"><sup>[26]</sup></a> <em>o</em> fits into the top of the tube, and, by means of
a little projecting piece fitting into a slot in the frame, can always
be adjusted so as to have its cross-wires parallel to the planes of
vibration of the two nicols.<a class="c011 pginternal" href="#f25"><sup>[25]</sup></a></p>

<p class="c007">Some instruments are provided with an additional slot in the
tube between the analyzer and the eye-piece for the introduction
of a Bertrand lens, which is used to magnify the interference figures
produced by convergent light.</p>

<p class="c007">The first approximate focusing is made by the screw <em>m</em>, and the
fine adjustment by the screw <em>n</em>.</p>

<p class="c007">In focusing always start with the objective very near the section,
and move it away until the right focus is obtained. Never move
down towards the section in obtaining the focus, as there is danger
then of striking the objective against the section.</p>

<p class="c007">For cleaning the microscope xylol can be used, as it will not
injure the lacquer. To lubricate any of the parts use a small
quantity of soft tallow, good clock oil or paraffin oil.</p>

</div>

<p class="c006"><strong>Characters of Opaque Minerals</strong>, observed by <em>reflected</em> light.</p>

<p class="c007">The minerals which remain perfectly opaque in thin rock sections
have usually metallic lustre and are very minute in size, as is the
case with the iron ores.</p>

<p class="c007">When the metallic minerals of a rock specimen are distinctly
seen with the unaided eye, it is rarely necessary to make a section
for their determination, as this can more easily be done by any of
the well known blowpipe methods.</p>

<p class="c007">Form, Lustre, Color, Cleavage, etc., are recognized in the same
way as in the case of macroscopic specimens. In order to make the
observations by reflected light alone, the beam of light from the
reflector-mirror must be cut off by holding the hand over the mirror
or by moving the mirror.</p>

<p class="c007"><strong>Characters of Transparent Minerals</strong>, observed by <em>transmitted</em>
light. The petrographical microscope for these observations is
supposed to be in the condition of an ordinary microscope, both
nicols being out of the field and a strong beam of light coming up
through the transparent section from the reflector below.</p>

<p class="c007">The characters are considered in the order in which they would
most naturally appear to the observer during a complete investigation
with the microscope.<a id="r27"></a><a class="c011 pginternal" href="#f27"><sup>[27]</sup></a></p>

Such crystals are often called <em>idiomorphic</em> or <em>automorphic</em>, see Fig. 4. Crystals that are large in comparison with other accompanying crystals may be called <em>Phenocrysts</em>. Of course crystals, which are not wholly contained within the rock section, will only show the outline of the bounding planes cut by this particular section. In some cases, by a careful study of the outline of several sections of the same mineral and by a measurement of the angles, it is possible to determine the common “crystallographic
<span class="pageno" id="Page_15">15</span>forms” of the mineral. Very misleading outlines may,
however, be observed; as for example the triangular outline of a
section of a cube, with the corner truncated. For measuring the
angles have the stage accurately centered, then bring the vertex
of the angle to be measured to the intersection of the cross-wires
in the eye-piece. Bring one of the sides in coincidence with one
of the cross-wires. Note the reading of the graduated circle and
rotate the section until the other side is in coincidence with the
same wire. Take the reading again and the difference will be the
angle required.</p>

<p class="c007"><em>Crystals without bounding planes</em>, whose surfaces are more or
less determined by those of adjacent crystals. Such crystals are
frequently called <em>allotriomorphic</em> or <em>xenomorphic</em>,<a id="r29"></a><a class="c011 pginternal" href="#f29"><sup>[29]</sup></a> see Fig. 5.

<p class="c007">(<em>c</em>) <strong>Index of Refraction.</strong> <em>n</em> = sin <em>i</em>/sin <em>r</em>. This can be approximately
determined by the appearance of the surface and outline
of a mineral, that is by its <em>relief</em>. The descriptive terms are
of course relative, but in common practice minerals are said to
have <em>medium</em> refraction when the refractive index is between that
of balsam (1.54) and that of calcite (1.60), <em>strong</em> refraction when
higher than 1.60 and <em>weak</em> refraction when lower than 1.54. In
the case of uniaxial and biaxial minerals the mean value of the
indices of refraction is used.</p>

<p class="c007">A mineral which has <em>strong refraction</em> appears to have <em>high
relief</em>, <em>i. e.</em>, distinct dark contours and a rough or “shagreened”
<span class="pageno" id="Page_18">18</span>surface,<a id="r31"></a><a class="c011 pginternal" href="#f31"><sup>[31]</sup></a> which has bright illumination and appears to stand out
above the surfaces of the surrounding minerals with weaker refraction,
see Fig. 9.</p>

<p class="c007">A mineral with <em>medium refraction</em> does not show any <em>relief</em>,
hence has a smooth surface and no dark contours, see Fig. 5.</p>

<p class="c007">A mineral with <em>weak refraction</em> may also appear to have a
rough surface, but not so marked as in the case of a mineral with
very strong refraction, due to the smaller contrast in indices
between the mineral and balsam.</p>

<p class="c007">The practical way of testing for the approximate index of refraction
or the <em>relief</em> of a mineral is to make use of the lens for convergent
light, which is placed on top of the lower nicol immediately
below the section.</p>

<p class="c007">By lowering<a id="r32"></a><a class="c011 pginternal" href="#f32"><sup>[32]</sup></a> the lens the character of the relief of a mineral
section is made very apparent.</p>

<p class="c007">In order to become familiar with the way in which the “relief”
or appearance of the surface indicates the strength of the refractive
index, the student may use a long glass slide on which are embedded
in balsam (1.54) small fragments of different minerals, for
example: Sodalite (1.483), orthoclase (1.523), quartz (1.547),
topaz (1.620), hornblende (1.631), augite (1.70), epidote (1.751),
zircon (1.95) and rutile (2.712).</p>

<p class="c007">Determinations of refractive indices in sections by the methods

difficulties and may fail to give satisfactory results. The
Becke method, however, often furnishes a convenient means of
determining the <em>relative</em> values of the refractive indices of adjoining
minerals or of minerals embedded in balsam. This is of
especial service when one of the minerals is known and hence its
refractive index.</p>

<h3 class="c013"> <span class="sc">Becke Method.</span><a id="r35"></a><a class="c011 pginternal" href="#f35"><sup>[35]</sup></a></h3>

<p class="c014">Suppose two adjoining minerals, in a thin rock section, to be
singly refracting and to have their plane of contact vertical, <em>i. e.</em>,
parallel to the optic axis of the microscope.</p>

<p class="c007">Let <em>A</em> and <em>C</em>, Fig. 10, be two such sections with the plane of contact
<em>OO′</em> vertical, <em>A</em> having a lower refractive index than <em>C</em>, and
consider only the direction of the rays within the section, neglecting
the refractive effect of the air, glass and balsam.</p>

<p class="c007">A beam of transmitted light contains besides normal rays convergent
rays, which pass through the section as indicated in Fig.
10. Consider now the cone of light rays <em>GBI</em>. The rays <em>O′G</em> on
meeting the plane of contact <em>OO′</em> will be somewhat concentrated
and deflected by the higher refractive index of <em>C</em> and will continue
as the cone <em>EF</em>. Some rays as <em>O′H</em> will, on meeting the contact
plane, be totally reflected and will continue as the cone <em>OE</em>, while
the rest of the rays <em>HI</em> will be dispersed and deflected by the weaker
refractive index of <em>A</em>, continuing as the cone <em>OD</em>. Hence, more
light rays will emerge on the side of the contact plane where
the substance of higher refractive index lies, and there will
be a concentration of illumination on this side producing the
so-called “bright line.”</p>

introduce  below the section a small light-stop, to reduce in size the cone of incident light.<a id="r37"></a><a class="c011 pginternal" href="#f37"><sup>[37]</sup></a> The
adapter, holding this light-stop, should be adjustable so that the stop
can be lowered sufficiently to produce the best results. The smaller the
contrast between the indices of refraction the smaller the incident cone
of light should be, as best results are obtained when this cone is little
larger than twice <em>O′H</em>, Fig. 10, all the <em>O′H</em> rays being
then totally reflected. The more of the <em>HI</em> rays that pass through,
the brighter will be the <em>OD</em> cone and the less sharp the contrast
in illumination. A high power objective<a id="r38"></a><a class="c011 pginternal" href="#f38"><sup>[38]</sup></a> should
be used, as those with small aperture and great focal length do not give
good results. Focus on the dividing plane and adjust until equal illumination
is observed on both sides and the trace of the plane resembles a fine thread,
the focal plane being at <em>MN</em>. Then <em>raise</em> the <em>objective</em>
slightly, thus moving the focal plane to <em>ST</em>, when a <em>bright
line</em> or band will appear on the side of the <em>stronger refracting</em>
substance, the width of the line depending on the contrast between
<em>n</em> and <em>n′</em>, becoming narrower as <em>n</em> and <em>n′</em>
approach each other in value. On raising the objective still further the line
<span class="pageno" id="Page_21">21</span>broadens and finally disappears. If the objective is lowered instead
of raised the reverse phenomenon will take place, the bright
line appearing on the side of the weaker refracting substance.<a id="r39"></a><a class="c011 pginternal" href="#f39"><sup>[39]</sup></a>
When the indices are nearly the same a bright line will appear on
both sides and it is important then to make the cone of incident
light as small as possible and to select the <em>brighter</em> line.</p>

<p class="c007">With doubly refracting minerals, each set of doubly refracted
rays would suffer total reflection under somewhat different conditions
and there would be no one point <em>B</em> (as in isotropic minerals)
where no bright lines would appear. However, if the cone of incident
light is small enough in diameter, the test will be practically
obtained as described. The Becke test can often be made with a
medium power objective<a id="r40"></a><a class="c011 pginternal" href="#f40"><sup>[40]</sup></a> without removing the polarizer and condensing
lens, provided the condensing lens be lowered sufficiently.
It may also prove convenient to turn the reflector a little sideways.</p>

<p class="c007">The thinner the section the more distinct will be the phenomenon.
The contact plane must be clear and not coated with opaque
decomposition products.</p>

<p class="c007">When the plane of contact <em>OO′</em> deviates considerably from
parallelism with the optic axis of the microscope a disturbance of
the phenomenon may be expected and no satisfactory results be
obtained. In general under these conditions the “bright line,”
both on raising and lowering the objective, will remain on the side
of the overlapping substance, without regard to the relative values
of the indices.</p>

<p class="c007">The refractive index of the cementing material should not be
very much lower than that of either of the thin sections, as the
result would then be to disperse the emerging rays too much and
dim the effect. In the case of distinguishing between minerals of
high refractive power, such as augite and garnet, methyliodide is
recommended instead of balsam.</p>

<p class="c007">In the case of doubly refracting crystals, the lower nicol (polarizer)
must be retained, if it is desired to obtain the relative refractive
index of one of the two rays, either with respect to the balsam
or to a ray in an adjoining crystal with a parallel vibration direction.
For determining vibration directions of rays and the faster
and slower rays in two adjoining sections see later, pp. <a href="#Page_31" class="pginternal">31</a> and <a href="#Page_33" class="pginternal">33</a>.</p>

<p class="c007"><span class="pageno" id="Page_22">22</span>The method of <em>Schrœder van der Kolk</em><a id="r41"></a><a class="c011 pginternal" href="#f41"><sup>[41]</sup></a> can also be employed for
the same purpose as the Becke test. The ordinary objective (Seibert
No. II) is used, and the method essentially consists of darkening
a portion of the field by means of the finger or a plate
inserted below the polarizer. The condenser lens must be lowered
beyond the sharp focus of the edge of the shadow (on raising
the condenser the following phenomena are <em>reversed</em>). As the
shadow approaches the contact between two minerals a bright line
will appear on the edge of the “far” mineral, if its refractive
index is the higher, and a dark line on this same edge if its index
is lower than that of the “near” mineral. The indices of the two
rays in doubly refracting minerals must be determined by the aid
of the polarizer.</p>

<h3 class="c013">Characters Observed by Polarized Light.</h3>

<p class="c014">The polarized light is obtained by passing the beam of light
from the reflector through the polarizer or lower nicol,<a id="r44"></a><a class="c011 pginternal" href="#f44"><sup>[44]</sup></a> which
must be in place below the stage of the microscope. White light
is supposed to be used.</p>

<p class="c007"><strong>Pleochroism</strong>, that property which all anisotropic minerals have,
to a greater or less extent, of absorbing certain colored rays in
certain directions, thereby showing different colors in different
directions by transmitted light. Uniaxial minerals are dichroic
showing two differences in color, produced by the rays which
vibrate parallel to the direction of the vertical axis <em>ć</em> and the plane
of the basal axes. Biaxial crystals are trichroic showing theoretically
three differences of color produced by rays with vibration
directions corresponding very nearly to those of the three principal
vibration directions.<a id="r45"></a><a class="c011 pginternal" href="#f45"><sup>[45]</sup></a> Any given section of a biaxial crystal will,
of course, appear only dichroic.</p>

<p class="c007">The practical way of testing for <em>pleochroism</em> is as follows: Revolve
the stage, carrying the section, when a change in the color
of the mineral will be noticed, if it is pleochroic. This pleochroism
<span class="pageno" id="Page_26">26</span>may appear as an actual change in color or simply as a change in
the shade of the same color. At times it may be so weak as
hardly to be noticed, when it is best to make the test with the
condensing lens in position immediately under the section, or by
rotating the lower nicol instead of revolving the stage. The color
of the light, vibrating parallel to certain definite crystallographic
directions in minerals, is often very characteristic.</p>

<p class="c007">In some cases there may be such strong <em>absorption</em> of one of the
rays, that, when the vibration direction of this ray is over the plane
of vibration of the polarizer, practically no light is transmitted and
the section appears dark. Strong absorption is characteristic of
certain minerals, such as biotite, amphibole, tourmaline and allanite
and takes place parallel to definite directions in these minerals.</p>

<p class="c007">Pleochroism may often be noticed with ordinary light in the
case of hand specimens.</p>

<h3 class="c013">Characters Observed with both Polarizer and Analyzer<a id="r46"></a><a class="c011 pginternal" href="#f46"><sup>[46]</sup></a> in Position, that is with “Crossed Nicols.”</h3>

<p class="c014">When the nicols are accurately crossed, the field should be
quite dark, and if this is not the case the adjustments must be
looked to. The condensing lens should be removed for these
tests as they are to be made with parallel light, but as a matter of
convenience instead of removing the condensing lens, the polarizer
with the lens on top may be lowered, when the results will be about
the same as with parallel light. White light is supposed to be used.</p>

<p class="c007"><strong>Isotropic Character.</strong> Sections of isotropic crystals are perfectly
dark and remain so during a complete rotation of the stage
through 360°. The explanation is very simple. Light being
transmitted by an isotropic crystal in all directions without double
refraction; it follows that the light from the polarizer, after having
passed through the section, comes to the analyzer still vibrating
in the plane of vibration of the polarizer. Hence it is entirely cut
out by the analyzer.</p>

<p class="c007"><em>Amorphous</em> transparent substances act in the same way and remain
dark during complete rotation of the stage.</p>

<p class="c007"><span class="pageno" id="Page_27">27</span><em>Optical anomalies</em>, <em>i. e.</em>, double refraction, may occur in isometric
crystals and in amorphous substances that have been subjected to
strains.</p>

<p class="c007"><strong>Anisotropic Character.</strong> Sections of anisotropic crystals, having
the property of <em>double refraction</em>, produce in general some
<em>interference</em> or <em>polarization color</em>, except as mentioned later. The
popular explanation is as follows:</p>

<div class="figcenter id005">
<img alt="" class="ig001" src="images/image027.jpg" id="img_images_image027.jpg">
<div class="ic002">
<p><span class="sc">Fig. 16.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="c007">In Fig. 16, let PP′ be the plane of vibration of the polarizer,
and A′A the plane of vibration of the analyzer. All the light,
after it has passed through the polarizer, is vibrating parallel to
PP′ when it reaches the lower side of the transparent crystal, <em>cdef</em>,
on the stage of the microscope. In this transparent section let
<em>ob</em> and <em>oa</em> be the two <em>directions</em> of <em>vibration</em>, <em>i. e.</em>, the only two
directions parallel to which rays of light can vibrate in passing
through the section.</p>

<p class="c007">Let <em>om</em> represent the amplitude of vibration of a ray from the
polarizer. When this ray reaches the section it cannot get through
it vibrating in the direction <em>om</em>, but is doubly refracted and of the
two resulting rays, one gets through vibrating in the direction <em>ob</em>
and the other vibrating in the direction <em>oa</em>. From <em>m</em> draw perpendiculars
<span class="pageno" id="Page_28">28</span>to <em>ob</em> and <em>oa</em>. Then according to the law of the
parallelogram of forces <em>ob</em> will represent the amplitude of vibration
of the ray passing through the crystal vibrating in the direction
<em>ob</em>, and <em>oa</em> will represent the amplitude of vibration of the ray
passing through the crystal vibrating in the direction <em>oa</em>. We
will thus have two rays passing through the crystal, polarized at
right angles to each other.</p>

<div class="figleft id002">
<img alt="" class="ig001" src="images/image028.jpg" id="img_images_image028.jpg">
<div class="ic002">
<p><span class="sc">Fig. 17.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="c007">Consider now the general question of the transmission of the
doubly refracted rays through a plate. Whatever the angle of the
parallel incident rays, each ray as AB, Fig.
17, is resolved, as just described, into two rays
BC and BD, polarized at right angles to each
other and following (usually) different paths
in the plate. On emergence these follow parallel
paths. Among the incident rays there are
rays EG and FH, such that one component
of FH will emerge at D with one of the components
of AB, and one component of AB
and one component of EG will emerge at C.
Hence from every point of the upper surface of the plate there will
emerge two rays and these rays will have travelled through different
paths in the plate with different velocities and will have their
vibrations at right angles to each other.</p>

<p class="c007">When these doubly refracted rays come to the analyzer, whose
plane of vibration is A′A, they cannot get through vibrating in their
present directions, but components of these rays, such as <em>ot</em> and <em>os</em>,
can get through vibrating parallel to the plane A′A.</p>

<p class="c007">Hence we have two series of rays coming to the eye, polarized
in the same plane, but one set slightly in advance of the other.
These rays will “interfere” and produce some <em>interference</em> or
<em>polarization</em> color.<a id="r47"></a><a class="c011 pginternal" href="#f47"><sup>[47]</sup></a> In using white light whenever one of two
light rays of the same color has suffered a “retardation” of just
one wave-length (or even multiple thereof) the color will be extinguished;
and when the “retardation” is one half wave-length
(or even multiple thereof) the color will be intensified. Therefore,
some tints will be extinguished and others intensified, the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_29">29</span>combination resulting in the production of some definite interference
color. Of course in the case of monochromatic light
the thickness of the section may be such that “destructive interference”
takes place producing no color (darkness).</p>

<p class="c007">Now suppose the stage to be rotated until the section <em>cdef</em>
takes the position <em>c′d′e′f′</em>. The section will be found to be dark
and no interference color will be seen. This is due to the fact that
the directions of vibration in the section are parallel to the planes
of vibration of the crossed nicols, consequently the light passes
through the section still vibrating parallel to the plane PP′ of the
polarizer and is all cut out by the analyzer. Darkness will occur
every 90° and therefore four times during a complete rotation of
the stage. The interference color is also observed to vary in
intensity, but not in color, and to be at its maximum 45° from the
positions of darkness.</p>

<p class="c007">Sections of uniaxial crystals at right angles to the optic axis act
like isotropic substances and remain dark during a complete rotation
of the stage. In the biaxial crystals, a section at right angles
to an “optic axis” shows uniform illumination<a id="r48"></a><a class="c011 pginternal" href="#f48"><sup>[48]</sup></a> which does not
change as the stage is rotated.</p>

<p class="c007">The only way to find out whether sections that remain dark
are isotropic, or uniaxial at right angles to an optic axis, is to
test them with convergent light as described later, see p. <a href="#Page_40" class="pginternal">40</a>.</p>

<p class="c007"><strong>Interference Colors.</strong> The interference color shown by any mineral
section depends on three factors: 1° the strength of the double
refraction (<em>γ</em> − <em>α</em> = the difference between the refractive indices of
the slowest and fastest rays); 2° the position of the section in the
crystal; 3° the thickness of the crystal section.</p>

<p class="c007">To eliminate, so far as possible, the variation due to the optical
orientation of the section, care must always be taken to obtain the
maximum interference color given by the different sections of the
same mineral in the rock section. Sections giving the maximum
color are those parallel to the <em>ć</em> axis in uniaxial minerals and those
parallel to the axial plane in biaxial minerals.<a id="r49"></a><a class="c011 pginternal" href="#f49"><sup>[49]</sup></a> Hence such sections
in convergent light never show the emergence of an optic
axis or a bisectrix; and furthermore, other clues, such as crystal
<span class="pageno" id="Page_30">30</span>outlines, cleavage, pleochroism, etc., may help to indicate the
favorable section.</p>

<p class="c007">The influence of the thickness of the section is also important
and must be considered. The interference color will rise in the
scale (be higher in order) as the section becomes thicker. Methods
of obtaining the thickness of a section are given on pp. <a href="#Page_35" class="pginternal">35</a> and <a href="#Page_36" class="pginternal">36</a>.
When reference is made to definite interference colors the mineral
section is supposed to have a thickness of 0.03 mm. and to be such
as to give the maximum color; and all mineral sections in a rock section
are considered to have a uniform thickness.</p>

<p class="c007">With these precautions in mind the <em>interference colors</em> indicate
the <em>strength</em> of the <em>double refraction</em> as follows:<a id="r50"></a><a class="c011 pginternal" href="#f50"><sup>[50]</sup></a> The colors of minerals
with very weak double refraction vary from a bluish-gray to
a grayish-white. As the strength of the double refraction increases
the colors become the very intense bright tints of the spectrum,
yellow, red, blue, green, etc., called the first and second order
colors. As the strength of the double refraction still increases the
colors pass through the tints of the spectrum in sequence (called
orders), becoming paler until finally, when the double refraction is
very strong, the colors become the neutral, almost colorless tints
of the higher orders. The eye must be trained to appreciate the
colors of different orders, and the student is advised to practice
with mineral sections, of known strength of double refraction, and
compare the resulting interference colors with a color chart,<a id="r51"></a><a class="c011 pginternal" href="#f51"><sup>[51]</sup></a> or
use the interference color diagram at the end of the book. A
convenient test can be made with a one fourth undulation mica
plate to distinguish between the white of the 1° order and the
practically white very high order tint. Introduce the mica plate
in the slot <em>k</em>, Fig. 2, and the effect will be to produce a marked
change in the color of the 1° order, while no change will be observed
in the high order color.</p>

<p class="c007">The exact order of the color can be determined by the use of a
quartz wedge, as described on p. <a href="#Page_35" class="pginternal">35</a>.</p>

<p class="c007"><em>Abnormal Interference Colors</em><a id="r52"></a><a class="c011 pginternal" href="#f52"><sup>[52]</sup></a> may be brought about in several
<span class="pageno" id="Page_31">31</span>ways. In white light strong absorption of part of the light components
may not only alter the color of the mineral but also modify
the interference color. The double refraction may be nearly zero
for light of a particular color so that the mineral is isotropic for
that color, resulting in a change in the interference color, as for
example the indigo of melilite, which is nearly isotropic for yellow
light. In biaxial minerals the axial angle may be zero for light
of a particular color, resulting also in a modification of the interference
color, as the blue in penninite in sections ⟂ <em>Bx<sub>a</sub></em>. When
the bisectrices are much dispersed there will be no position of
darkness between crossed nicols in white light.</p>

<p class="c007"><strong>Extinction and Extinction Angles.</strong> When the section, see Fig.
16, is in such a position that its directions of vibration are parallel
to the planes of vibration of the nicols, no light can pass through
the analyzer, and the section is dark. Hence the light is extinguished
and this phenomenon is called <em>extinction</em>.</p>

<p class="c007"><em>Extinction</em> is said to be <em>parallel</em> or <em>symmetrical</em> when the directions
of vibration are parallel to any crystallographic lines or directions,
or bisect the angles between these lines. The crystallographic
lines or directions may be either cleavages or the similar
boundaries of idiomorphic crystals.</p>

<p class="c007">This kind of <em>extinction</em> is shown by all sections of tetragonal and
hexagonal crystals, by all sections parallel to the crystal axes in
orthorhombic crystals and also by the sections parallel to the ƃ
axis in monoclinic crystals.</p>

<p class="c007">When the <em>extinction</em> is not symmetrical it is called <em>oblique</em>, and
is shown by all sections of monoclinic crystals (except those parallel
to the ƃ axis) and triclinic crystals.</p>

<p class="c007">Extinction which does not take place over the whole of the section
of a single crystal at the same moment, but passes over the
section like a dark wave or shadow, is said to be “<em>wavy</em>”; and
indicates that the crystal has been subjected to mechanical forces
producing a change in the position of the directions of vibration in
different parts of the crystal, see Fig. 7.</p>

<p class="c007">The angle between a direction of vibration in the section and
some known crystallographic direction (as a cleavage or crystal
outline) is called an <em>extinction angle</em>, and is measured in the following
way: Find the positions of the directions of vibration in the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_32">32</span>section, which must be parallel to the cross-wires when extinction
takes place. Note the reading on the graduated circle of the stage,
then remove the upper nicol, in order to get a more distinct view
of the field, and rotate the stage until you bring some known crystallographic
line into parallel position with the cross-wire selected
as a reference line. Take the reading of the graduated circle again,
and the difference between these two readings will be the <em>extinction
angle</em>.</p>

<p class="c007">It can readily be seen that depending on which way the section
is rotated, either a small or a large extinction angle will be obtained,
the two angles being complements of each other. The
extinction angle generally recorded is that between the nearest
direction of vibration and the vertical axis <em>ć</em>.</p>

<p class="c007">In monoclinic minerals the maximum value of the extinction
angle (the angle of real value in distinguishing the mineral) can
only be obtained from a section parallel to the clino pinacoid (010);
but in practice sufficiently accurate results can generally be obtained
by measuring the extinction angles of all sections of the
same mineral, which seem to be about parallel to the vertical axis
<em>ć</em>, and then taking the maximum value obtained. Amphibole and
pyroxene can easily be distinguished in this way.</p>

<p class="c007"><em>Extinction</em> is generally tested for by revolving the stage, carrying
the section, until darkness is observed. The principal difficulty,
however, is caused by the eye failing to appreciate the
position of maximum darkness. Hence it is better to revolve
the stage until the section just becomes dark (or fades out) and
then revolve further until the section just begins to lighten up
again. The mean of the readings, in these two positions, will be
the one to use.</p>

<p class="c007">A gypsum test-plate, so prepared as to give some definite
interference color, as red of the 1° order, may be introduced
between the two nicols, and the section revolved until this color
is exactly matched. This perfect matching of color is only possible
when the directions of vibration of the section are exactly parallel
to the planes of vibration of the nicols, as otherwise some interference
color would be produced by the section and the true color
of the test-plate would not appear. The most favorable condition
is when the section is colorless and only covers a part of the field
<span class="pageno" id="Page_33">33</span>of view, as then the rest of the field shows the color of the test-plate
and the exact matching of color is an easy matter. This
method of testing can be employed to recognize the very weak
double refraction of some minerals, whose interference colors
are such dark grays as not to be noticed without this test. After
the test-plate has been introduced, some slight variation in the
color will be observed when the stage carrying the doubly refracting
section is rotated. There are other methods<a id="r53"></a><a class="c011 pginternal" href="#f53"><sup>[53]</sup></a> for locating
these directions of vibration. They depend generally on substituting
changes of color for degrees of darkness or on changes in
interference figures, and consist in the use of color test-plates
or Klein’s quartz-plate, or of special oculars prepared by Bertrand,
Calderon, etc.</p>

<h3 class="c013"><span class="sc">Method of Testing for the Vibration Directions of the Faster and Slower Rays, <em>a′</em> and <em>c′</em>, in a Mineral Section</span>.</h3>

<p class="c014">A mica or gypsum plate can be used to make this test, the directions
of vibration of the faster and slower rays on these plates
being known and marked.<a id="r54"></a><a class="c011 pginternal" href="#f54"><sup>[54]</sup></a></p>

<p class="c007">The crystal section to be tested is placed on the rotating stage,
between crossed nicols, and turned to the position of extinction,
when these directions of vibration will be parallel to the cross-wires
in the eye-piece. The section is then turned 45°, when the interference
color will be at its maximum, and these directions of vibration
will make angles of 45° with the planes of vibration of the
nicols and the cross-wires in the eye-piece.</p>

<p class="c007">Now introduce<a id="r55"></a><a class="c011 pginternal" href="#f55"><sup>[55]</sup></a> the test-plate, between the section and the analyzer,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_34">34</span>so that its known directions of vibration also make angles
of 45° with the cross-wires in the eye-piece.</p>

<p class="c007">When the test-plate is introduced a new interference color will
be noticed which is either higher or lower in the color scale<a id="r56"></a><a class="c011 pginternal" href="#f56"><sup>[56]</sup></a> than
the original interference color of the mineral section. When the
known directions of vibration of the test-plate are superposed over
corresponding directions in the mineral section, the effect is to
thicken the section and the interference color rises in the scale.</p>

<p class="c007">When the directions of vibration of the test-plate are superposed
over directions of vibration in the mineral section which are not
corresponding, the effect is to thin the section and the interference
color sinks in the scale.</p>

<p class="c007">For minerals which have very strong double refraction, as zircons,
so that the interference colors are of the higher orders, it is
advisable to use the method of testing with a quartz wedge.<a id="r57"></a><a class="c011 pginternal" href="#f57"><sup>[57]</sup></a></p>

<p class="c007">If a wedge is inserted between crossed nicols and its <em>c</em> direction
inclined at 45° to the planes of vibration of the nicols, then successive
interference colors will be seen commencing with the gray
of the first order and passing through the colors as shown by a
color chart. If now the crystal section lies with its vibration directions
also in the diagonal position, the color of any portion of the
quartz wedge will be changed where it covers the section, the new
color being that of a thicker part of the wedge if the <em>c</em> direction
in the section lies under the <em>c</em> direction of the wedge. Also where
the wedge overlaps the section the displacement of the color fringes
in the section will be towards the thin edge of the wedge. On the
other hand the new color will be that of a thinner part of the wedge
when the <em>a</em> direction in the section lies under the <em>c</em> direction of the
wedge. In this case the displacement of the color fringes will be
towards the thick part of the wedge.</p>

<p class="c007">This method is very convenient when the crystal section has in
<span class="pageno" id="Page_35">35</span>any place sloping edges, showing prismatic color fringes. The
movement of these fringes (as previously described) is towards the
thin edge of the wedge when the vibration directions correspond
and away from this edge when they do not correspond.</p>

<p class="c007">If the wedge when inserted finally “compensates” the color of
the crystal section (<em>i. e.</em>, practically produces an absence of color,
darkness), then the a in this section must lie under the c in the wedge,
as the effect of the wedge has been to continually thin the section.</p>

<h3 class="c013"> <span class="sc">Determination of Order of Interference Color.</span></h3>

<p class="c014">This can be determined by use of a quartz wedge or a v. Federow
mica wedge.<a id="r58"></a><a class="c011 pginternal" href="#f58"><sup>[58]</sup></a> Have the vibration directions of the given section
in the diagonal position, then gradually insert the wedge between
the crossed nicols so that the corresponding vibration directions in
the section and wedge are crossed, that is so that the colors are
run down until finally dark gray or black is obtained. Count the
number of times the original interference color reappears, if <em>n</em>
times, then the color is a red, blue, green, etc., of <em>n</em> + 1 order.<a id="r59"></a><a class="c011 pginternal" href="#f59"><sup>[59]</sup></a></p>

<p class="c007">It is often easier to insert the wedge until compensation of the
color is obtained; then as the wedge is pulled out the direct count

<p class="c014">“The wedge<a id="r61"></a><a class="c011 pginternal" href="#f61"><sup>[61]</sup></a> consists of fifteen superposed quarter undulation
mica plates, each about two mm. shorter than the one beneath it
and with their directions of vibration parallel. The series is
mounted on a strip of glass and covered with a cover-glass.</p>

<p class="c007">The wave-length of a middle color may be taken as 560 μμ
(millionths of a millimeter); hence each quarter undulation mica
plate may be considered to possess a phase difference or retardation
of 140 μμ. If, then, between the polarizer and analyzer we
insert the mica wedge, so that its direction of vibration of the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_36">36</span>slower ray, <em>c</em>, is at right angles to that of the mineral under examination,
we subtract from the phase difference of the mineral an
amount equal to <em>n</em> times 140 μμ, in which <em>n</em> represents the number
of superposed mica plates in the field. When the mineral appears
dark the value evidently corresponds closely to the phase difference
of the mineral.<a id="r62"></a><a class="c011 pginternal" href="#f62"><sup>[62]</sup></a></p>

<p class="c007">From the expression Δ = <em>eX</em>, in which Δ is the phase difference
or retardation, <em>X</em> the double refraction, and <em>e</em> the thickness in
millionths of millimeters, the thickness can be deduced when the
double refraction is known or <em>vice versa</em>. If a mineral of known
double refraction can be found in the section near the mineral under
investigation,<a id="r63"></a><a class="c011 pginternal" href="#f63"><sup>[63]</sup></a> the double refraction of the latter can be deduced
by measuring the phase difference of the known mineral, whence
e results, and this substituted in the above formula yields <em>X</em>.”</p>

The strength of the double refraction of this mineral being known,
look up on the diagram the diagonal line corresponding to this
double refraction and follow along this line toward the left hand
lower corner until the observed interference color is reached, when
the horizontal line will indicate the thickness of the section. The
thickness is given in hundredths of millimeters. Then in the case
of the unknown mineral pick out the section giving the highest
interference color and carry along the same horizontal line until
this new color is located,<a id="r66"></a><a class="c011 pginternal" href="#f66"><sup>[66]</sup></a> then pass up to the right along the
diagonal line to the numbers indicating the strength of the double
<span class="pageno" id="Page_37">37</span>refraction of the unknown mineral. Turn to the table where the
minerals will be found having about this strength of double
refraction.</p>

<p class="c007"><em>Example:</em> In a section of granite (biotite-granite) a grain of
quartz was selected, which gave the brightest color. This color
was a bright yellowish white and the known double refraction of
quartz is 0.009. Following down on this diagonal line until the
interference color was reached it was seen that the thickness of the
section was about 0.03 mm. (a very thin section). The section
of the undetermined mineral, giving the highest order color, showed
a bright 2° order purple-blue. Passing along the 0.03 horizontal line
until this color was reached and then up along the diagonal line,
it was seen that the double refraction of this mineral must be about
0.04. The table gives muscovite and ægerite as having about
this double refraction. The mineral was proved to be muscovite by
its absence of color and relief and by the characteristic cleavage
and parallel extinction.</p>

<h3 class="c013">Characters Observed by Convergent Polarized Light.</h3>

<p class="c014"><em>Convergent light</em> is obtained by passing the rays of polarized
light through a strong condensing lens, which generally fits like a
cap over the top of the polarizer. By means of a suitable adjustment
the condensing lens can be brought very close to the lower
surface of the section on the stage. The lens thus sends a cone
of light through the section, and used in connection with <em>crossed
nicols</em> a series of optical phenomena, called <em>interference figures</em>,<a id="r68"></a><a class="c011 pginternal" href="#f68"><sup>[68]</sup></a>
are produced.</p>

<p class="c007">Each direction in which rays are sent is traversed by a minute
bundle of parallel rays and these rays extinguish and produce
interference colors as already described for parallel light. Hence
each direction yields a spot or picture in the field of view and from
all these spots combined there results an “interference figure” or
picture, depending upon the structure of the section for all the
directions traversed by the rays.</p>

<p class="c007">A very high power objective<a id="r69"></a><a class="c011 pginternal" href="#f69"><sup>[69]</sup></a> must be used, and when the eye-piece
is removed, a small image of the interference figure will be
seen. In some microscopes an arrangement is made for getting a
magnified image of the interference figure, by retaining the eye-piece
and using an additional Bertrand lens.</p>

<p class="c007">In order to get good results care must be taken to have strong
illumination and the condensing lens close up under the section.
The tests are best made with monochromatic light, but with white
light the effects are substantially the same, the only difference
being that the rings and curves are variously colored instead of
being simply light and dark.</p>

<p class="c007"><em>Isotropic</em> substances show no <em>interference figures</em>.</p>

<h3 class="c013">Uniaxial Interference Figures.</h3>

<p class="c014">(<em>a</em>) Sections perpendicular to the optic or vertical axis <em>ć</em> show a
dark cross, with or without colored rings, Figs. 23 and 24. The
<span class="pageno" id="Page_41">41</span>figure is symmetrical to the center, as the optical behavior of uniaxial
crystals is symmetrical to the optic axis.</p>

the section is rotated.<a id="r70"></a><a class="c011 pginternal" href="#f70"><sup>[70]</sup></a></p>

<p class="c007">(<em>b</em>) Sections oblique to the optic axis show a portion of a dark
cross, with or without colored rings, Fig. 25. The centre of the
cross is not in the axis of rotation, and as the stage bearing the
section is revolved, the centre of the cross describes a circle, the
arms always maintaining parallel positions.</p>

<p class="c007">If the section is still more oblique to the optic axis the centre
of the interference cross may be outside the field of view, and only
portions of the dark arms will be seen.</p>

<p class="c007">Sections parallel to the optic axis show
a vague dark cross, which, on rotating the
stage, dissolves into hyperbolic curves
(suggesting biaxial figure), which very
rapidly disappear in the direction of the
optic axis. When the interference figure
shows colors, these colors are lower in
order in the quadrants containing the
optic axis. Knowing thus the position of the optic axis the
optical character can be obtained by the method for parallel light,

<p class="c007">Sections which are thick and have strong double refraction will
show the cross and rings clearly and sharply defined, there being
quite a number of rings crowded close together. Sections which
<span class="pageno" id="Page_42">42</span>are very thin and have weak double refraction show only a broad
dark cross and no rings. The interference figures will vary between
these extremes, depending on the thickness of the section
and the strength of the double refraction.</p>

<p class="c007">To obtain the most characteristic figures, observations must be
made on sections about perpendicular to the optic axis, that is
sections which remain dark or nearly dark during complete rotation
between crossed nicols in parallel light.</p>

<p class="c007"><strong>Optical Character, Positive or Negative.</strong> After having obtained
an uniaxial interference figure, test it by means of a ¼ undulation
mica plate. This plate must be introduced between the objective<a id="r71"></a><a class="c011 pginternal" href="#f71"><sup>[71]</sup></a>
and the analyzer in such a way that its vibration direction c,
marked on the plate, makes an angle of 45° with the planes of
vibration of the nicols.</p>

<p class="c007">When this is done the interference figure changes, or may more
or less disappear, two dark spots or blotches being brought prominently
into view. If rings are still seen it will be noticed that
they have expanded in the quadrants occupied by the dark spots,
and have contracted in the remaining quadrants. This movement
of the rings may make it possible to determine the optical
character of a section, which is so oblique to the optic axis that
the dark spots are not seen after the introduction of the mica plate.</p>

<p class="c007">(<em>b</em>) Sections perpendicular to the acute bisectrix (see p. <a href="#Page_5" class="pginternal">5</a>), exhibit
interference figures like those shown in Figs. 30 and 31.</p>

<p class="c007">Fig. 30 shows the appearance of the interference figure when
the plane of the optic axes is parallel to the plane of vibration of
either nicol, and Fig. 31 shows the appearance when this plane is
inclined 45° to the planes of vibration of the nicols.</p>

<p class="c007">As the stage, carrying the section, is rotated the dark cross
seems to dissolve into two branches of a hyperbola, which again
unite to form a cross.</p>

<p class="c007">In sections perpendicular to a bisectrix, with a large axial angle,
the figure will appear, during a rotation of 90° (in the direction of
the hands of a watch), as in Fig. 32, top row. When the section
is somewhat oblique to an “optic axis,” the figure appears as in
middle row; and when still more oblique, as in bottom row.</p>

<p class="c007">The black centres<a id="r74"></a><a class="c011 pginternal" href="#f74"><sup>[74]</sup></a> of the small ellipses and the black hyperbolic
curves mark the points of emergence of the optic axes, and therefore
indicate approximately the size of the <em>axial angle</em>, 2<em>E</em>.</p>

<p class="c007">Sections in other positions, relative to the optic axes, give interference
figures less definite in appearance than those just described;
and the same conditions affect the appearance of all figures as in
<span class="pageno" id="Page_45">45</span>the case of uniaxial crystals. Very thin sections, of weak double
refraction, may only show indistinct dark crosses or hyperbolic
curves, without any ellipses.</p>

<p class="c007">The section perpendicular to the acute bisectrix, which gives the
most characteristic interference figure, cannot generally be recognized
except by an examination in convergent light. It is never,
however, the section giving the maximum interference color. The
interference colors in different sections, normal to the optical elements,
grade downward in the following order: (1) optic normal,
(2) obtuse bisectrix, (3) acute bisectrix, (4) optic axis. Sometimes
cleavage may furnish a clue as to the best section to test
as in Topaz and Mica, where the acute bisectrix is normal to the
cleavage.</p>

<p class="c007">It must be remembered that this uncertainty, in the choice of
sections for testing, does not exist in uniaxial crystals; where the
best sections are indicated by the fact that they remain dark or
nearly so during complete rotation between crossed nicols.</p>

<p class="c007">The uniaxial or biaxial character of a mineral section, which only
shows an indistinct bar, may be determined as follows: A bar (one
arm of the cross) of a uniaxial interference figure moves in the
same direction as the rotating stage, and always remains straight,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_46">46</span>while the biaxial bar rotates in the opposite direction to the stage
and becomes curved.</p>

<p class="c007"><strong>Optical Character, Positive or Negative.</strong> When the axial angle
is very small, so that the interference figure approaches that of a
uniaxial crystal, the methods used for testing uniaxial figures are
employed.</p>

<p class="c007">When, however, the axial angle is large, the following method
can be used:</p>

<p class="c007">After having obtained an interference figure, from a section as
nearly at right angles to the acute bisectrix<a id="r75"></a><a class="c011 pginternal" href="#f75"><sup>[75]</sup></a> as possible, the stage
is rotated until the plane of the optic axes (the trace of which on
the plane of the section is the line joining the points of emergence
of the two optic axes) makes an angle of 45° with the planes of vibration
of the crossed nicols or the cross-wires in the eye-piece.</p>

<p class="c007">A quartz wedge<a id="r76"></a><a class="c011 pginternal" href="#f76"><sup>[76]</sup></a> is now pushed in between the mineral section
and the analyzer,<a id="r77"></a><a class="c011 pginternal" href="#f77"><sup>[77]</sup></a> so that its axis <em>ć</em> = <span class="blackletter">c</span> (previously determined
and marked on the wedge) is either at right angles or parallel to
the plane of the optic axes of the mineral section.</p>

<p class="c007">The optical character of the mineral is <em>positive</em> when the ellipses,
surrounding the points of emergence of the two optic axes on the
convex sides of the hyperbola, appear to expand or open out
towards the centre when the quartz wedge is pushed in with its
axis parallel to the plane of the optic axes.</p>

<p class="c007">The optical character is <em>negative</em> when the ellipses appear to
expand or open out when the wedge is pushed in with its axis at
right angles to the plane of the optic axes.</p>

<p class="c007">As the ellipses expand they move from the points of emergence
of the optic axes towards the centre of the interference figure, and
<span class="pageno" id="Page_47">47</span>finally open into lemniscates which move outward from the plane
of the optic axes.</p>

<p class="c007">Even when the section is very thin and the double refraction
very weak, only the black hyperbolas without ellipses being seen,
the test can be made; and colored ellipses will appear, after the
pushing in of the quartz wedge, which will act in the same way as
the ellipses of the interference figure.</p>

<p class="c007">In a section at right angles to the <em>obtuse bisectric</em> these results
are all reversed.</p>

<p class="c007">When the section is perpendicular to one optic axis, rotate the
section until the plane of its optic axes is 45° to the planes of
vibration of the nicols. The interference figure will now have the
appearance as shown in Fig. 29, the hyperbola being convex
towards the acute bisectrix. Insert the ¼ undulation mica plate,
so that its direction c is parallel to the plane of the optic axes.
If the optical character is positive the hyperbola will move
towards the acute bisectrix and if negative away from it. When
the gypsum plate is used the blue color will appear on the convex
side for (+) and on the concave side for (−) minerals.</p>

<p class="c007"><strong>Determination of the Axial Angle.</strong><a id="r78"></a><a class="c011 pginternal" href="#f78"><sup>[78]</sup></a> This can be approximately
determined with a petrographical microscope, if equipped with a
micrometer eye-piece. Have the axial plane of the crystal section
in the diagonal position, Fig. 31; and measure the distance <em>d</em>
from the centre to either hyperbola with a micrometer (or average
the distance to both). Then sin <em>E = d/C</em>, in which <em>C</em> is a constant
for the same combination of lenses and is obtained by using
a crystal section (mica cleavage) of known axial angle. For
example, in a mica with 2<em>E</em> = 91° 50′ and <em>d</em> = 41.5 divisions on
the micrometer scale, <em>C = d</em>/sin <em>E</em> = 57.78 for that special combination
of lenses. The true axial angle can be obtained from the
equation sin <em>V = d/βC</em>.</p>

dispersion is said to be ρ &gt; ν and the interference figure, in the
position of Fig. 31, will show the hyperbolic curves fringed with
red towards the centre (inside). In general the color with the
larger axial angle is nearer the centre of the field. This is due to
the extinguishing of light of each color at the axial points, the resulting
colors at these points being produced by white light minus
the absorbed color. When the dispersion is ν &gt; ρ the reverse distribution
of color fringes will take place.</p>

<p class="c007">By measuring the axial angle in red and blue light, this dispersion
of the optic axes can also be obtained.</p>

  <h3 class="c013"> <span class="sc">Resumé of the Uses of Parallel and Convergent Polarized Light.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class="c014"><em>Parallel</em> light is used to detect pleochroism, to distinguish between
isotropic and anisotropic substances, to study interference
colors, to determine the strength of the double refraction, to locate
directions of vibration, to measure extinction angles, to find
the directions of vibration of the faster and slower rays, to determine
the relative value of the indices of refraction of the two rays,
and to investigate the crystal structure in general.</p>

<p class="c007"><em>Convergent</em> light is used to distinguish between uniaxial and biaxial
crystals, to determine whether a section that appears to be
isotropic is really so or only perpendicular to an optic axis and to
determine the optical character, grade of symmetry (system), axial
angle and dispersion.</p>

corrosion by curved and looped contours. In some diabases the quartz may be
surrounded by a rim of hornblende or augite needles (“quartz augen”). “Cataclastic”
quartz may be biaxial. The “secondary enlargement” of quartz in clastic

are noteworthy. Coarse aggregates of calcite occur in the crystalline schists

<p class="c007">The microscopic characters are similar to those of calcite, from

Ca predominating over the Mg.</p>

<p class="c007"><strong>Usual Appearance in Sections</strong>: Both in crystals and more or less
irregular grains, Figs. 4 and 12, the habit varying with the chemical
composition as follows:</p>

<p class="c007"><em>Diopside</em> (Ca, Mg varieties), long columnar crystals and grains.</p>

<p class="c007"><em>Augite</em> (ditto, but containing also Al and Fe), short prismatic
crystals and grains.</p>

<p class="c007"><em>Diallage</em>, granular or lamellar (|| (100)), may show fibrous
structure ∥ <em>ć</em>.</p>

<p class="c007">Prism angle = 87° 06′ (important in cross-sections). Sections of
crystals nearly at right angles to the vertical axis <em>ć</em> are octagonal
<span class="pageno" id="Page_81">81</span>or square with truncated corners, Figs. 4 and 53, while those parallel
to the <em>ć</em> axis are lath-shaped. Pyroxene also occurs in skeleton
crystals and acicular microlites in eruptive rocks.</p>

<p class="c007">Zonal structure (especially in augites) may be marked by differences
in color or extinction, and in some basalts the crystals have
the “hour-glass” structure.</p>

<p class="c007"><em>Twinning.</em>—Common, usually the twinning plane being the ortho
pinacoid (100). Twin lamellæ may be noticed. Intergrowths
occur with orthorhombic pyroxene and amphibole.</p>

<p class="c007"><em>Color.</em>—From almost colorless through green (diopsides, Na
pyroxenes, etc.) to brown (augites); the red to brownish-red color
of certain augites has been considered due to manganese. Yellow
color very rare.</p>

<p class="c007"><em>Index of Refraction.</em>—<em>n′</em> = 1.68 to 1.72 (α = 1.671 to 1.706,
γ = 1.700 to 1.728), hence <em>relief</em> high and surface rough.</p>

<p class="c007"><em>Cleavage.</em>—More or less perfect parallel to prism of 87° 06′.
Cleavage cracks distinct and numerous, but not generally running
uninterruptedly through crystal, Figs. 12 and 52. Cleavage not so
perfect as that of amphibole.</p>

<p class="c007"><em>Parting.</em>—Diallage and diopside have distinct parting parallel to
ortho pinacoid (100), Fig. 53. Some crystals may show parting
parallel to base (001).</p>

<p class="c007"><em>Inclusions.</em>—Tabular microscopic interpositions, similar to those
<span class="pageno" id="Page_82">82</span>in bronzite, may occur in diallage. The iron ores, apatite, etc.,
may occur in augite.</p>

<p class="c007"><em>Pleochroism.</em>—Usually not noticed, and in general only appearing
as different shades of the same color. In some cases (diallage,
fassaite and Na rich augite) well marked, <span class="blackletter">a</span> and <span class="blackletter">c</span> green to
yellowish green and <span class="blackletter">b</span> brownish to
reddish-brown; hence pleochroism not
intense in sections showing extinction
angles. When Ti is present, violet parallel
to <em>b</em>.</p>

<p class="c007"><strong><em>Crossed Nicols</em></strong>:</p>

<p class="c007"><em>Double Refraction.</em>—Strong (γ − α = 0.022
to 0.029), being stronger in the
pale or colorless pyroxenes.</p>

<p class="c007"><em>Interference Colors.</em>—Second order,
hence always bright tints.</p>

<p class="c007"><em>Extinction.</em>—Symmetrical in sections (through <em>b</em> axis) showing
intersecting cleavage lines, in such cases bisecting the angles of the
cleavage. In sections showing parallel cleavage lines, only parallel
in ortho pinacoid (100) sections, in all other sections an extinction
angle being observed. The maximum extinction angle is large,
lies in the obtuse angle, varies with the chemical composition from
36° 30′ to 54°, and is only obtained when the section of the
crystal is parallel to the clino pinacoid (010), Fig. 54, varying
from this angle to 0°, when the section is parallel to the ortho
pinacoid (100). In Ti and Na pyroxenes the inclined dispersion
is so great that extinctions are not sharp, but instead a change takes
place in the interference color from bluish to brownish.</p>

<p class="c007"><strong><em>Convergent Light</em></strong>: Axial plane parallel to clino pinacoid
(010). Fig. 54. A cleavage flake parallel to ortho pinacoid
(100) shows the emergence of an optic axis (orthorhombic pyroxene
parallel to best pinacoidal cleavage would not show figure).

<span class="pageno" id="Page_83">83</span>(uralitization<a id="r92"></a><a class="c011 pginternal" href="#f92"><sup>[92]</sup></a>), depending on the chemical composition and the

</div>
</div>

<p class="c007"><strong>Distinguished from</strong>:</p>

<p class="c007">(<em>a</em>) <span class="sc">Orthorhombic Pyroxenes.</span>—By extinction angle, the
orthorhombic pyroxenes having always parallel or symmetrical
extinction in sections parallel to <em>a</em>, <em>b</em>, or <em>c</em>, and by higher order
interference colors. Also from hypersthene
by absence of, or much fainter, pleochroism.
Diallage and bronzite might be confused on
account of pronounced pinacoidal parting,
fibrous structure and inclusions; but may be
distinguished by the presence or absence of
extinction angles and also by the position
of the optic axes relative to the best cleavage
plates.</p>

<p class="c007">(<em>b</em>) <span class="sc">Amphibole.</span>—See under amphibole.</p>

<p class="c007">(<em>c</em>) <span class="sc">Epidote</span> and <span class="sc">Chrysolite</span> (Olivine).
When light colored and granular, by examination
in convergent light. The plane of
the optic axes is parallel to the clino pinacoid (010), hence to
the longitudinal axis and prismatic cleavage cracks, while in epidote
it is at right angles to these directions and in chrysolite parallel to the
base. Also yellow color is common in epidote but rare in pyroxene.</p>

<p class="c018"><span class="sc">Remarks</span>: Next to the feldspars pryoxene is the most common constituent of
the igneous rocks. Diopside and fassaite (green) are found in contact rocks;
also, what appear to be the same pyroxenes, in many eruptive rocks, as andesites,
monzonites, etc. Malacolite (light green) is found in amphibolites and eclogites,
where it may be associated with a greenish amphibole (smaragdite). Diallage
(bladed and twinned) occurs in gabbros and pyroxenites. Common augite (brown)
is found in the remaining basic eruptive rocks. In the schists the pyroxene is
colorless.</p>

<p class="c019">Finally augite occurs as a secondary product resulting from the “magmatic
resorption” of hornblende and biotite.</p>

<p class="c019">Chemical corrosion and mechanical deformation may occur. The green and
brown augites when heated to redness on platinum foil may become red in color.
In general the pyroxenes are not attacked by acids. H., 5 to 6. Sp. gr., 3.3 to
3.5. The sp. gr. of the pyroxenes is considerably higher than that of the amphiboles
of similar composition, hence mechanical separations are possible.</p>

<p class="c006"><em>Acmite</em> (<em>Ægirine</em>) (Na pyroxenes).—Occur in green or brown,
elongated prismatic crystals, often not very transparent and with
<span class="pageno" id="Page_84">84</span>marked pleochroism (like amphibole). Zonal coloring is common.
When zonally intergrown with pyroxene the outer zone is ægirine.
The elongation is ∥ <span class="blackletter">a′</span> (distinction from amphibole whose elongation
is ∥ <span class="blackletter">c′</span>). The index of refraction is higher than in the other
pyroxenes (<em>n′</em> = 1.792, α = 1.763, γ = 1.813) and the double refraction
stronger (γ − α = 0.050). The <em>extinction</em> angle is small (5°)
and the optical character (—).</p>

<p class="c007">The term <em>Ægirine-augite</em> may be used to describe a soda, pleochroic
augite with a large extinction angle.</p>

<p class="c018">These pyroxenes are only found in the eruptive rocks rich in alkalies, as
elæolite-syenite, phonolite, certain trachytes, etc.; hence are associated with
elæolite, sodalite, leucite, etc. The small, second generation, crystals, in the
ground mass of a rock, are always the richest in Na of the pyroxenes in that rock.</p>

<p class="c007">Crystals are simple in form of prismatic habit, with prism angle
124° 30′. Cross-sections are acutely rhombic, generally with acute
angles truncated, hence six-sided (pyroxene being eight-sided).
Longitudinal sections are lath-shaped and fibrous structure may be
noticed. Skeleton crystals may also occur, being very fine in certain
pitchstones.</p>

<p class="c007">Zonal structure and parallel growth may be noticed in the
amphiboles.</p>

<p class="c007"><em>Twinning.</em>—Frequent, parallel to ortho pinacoid (100). Twins
dual, less often multiple, Fig. 55. Intergrowths with pyroxene and

<p class="c007"><em>Color.</em>—From colorless (tremolite), through green (actinolite,
pargasite and hornblende) to brown (basaltic hornblende). Yellow
in some varieties and bluish in the soda varieties.</p>

<p class="c007"><em>Index of Refraction.</em>—<em>n′</em> = 1.621 to 1.641 (α = 1.607 to 1.629,

</div>
</div>

<p class="c007"><strong>Polarized Light</strong>:</p>

<p class="c007"><em>Pleochroism.</em>—All colored amphiboles show pleochroism, which
in general is stronger the darker the color of the variety (actinolite
and pargasite show but little).
The absorption is very marked
in the hornblendes, being
greatest in the general direction
of the cleavage lines in
longitudinal sections. Marked
differences in absorption are
also characteristic of the mineral
species biotite, tourmaline
and allanite. Pleochroic halos (brownish) surrounding inclusions
may be noticed.</p>

<p class="c007"><em><strong>Crossed Nicols</strong></em>:</p>

<p class="c007"><em>Double Refraction.</em>—Quite strong, but a little weaker than in
pyroxene (γ-α = 0.019 to 0.027). Ferruginous basaltic hornblende
has strong double refraction (γ-α = 0.072).</p>

</div>

<p class="c007"><em>Interference Colors.</em>—Second order, hence
bright tints, but in darker colored varieties
not so noticeable as in pyroxenes, due to
the stronger absorption of parts of the
light. The colors of basaltic hornblende
are so high that they show no bright tints.</p>

<p class="c007"><em>Extinction.</em>—Always symmetrical in sections
(through <em>b</em> axis) showing intersecting
cleavage lines, in such cases bisecting the
angles of the cleavage. In sections
showing parallel cleavage lines, only
parallel in ortho pinacoid (100) sections,
in all other sections an extinction angle
being observed. The maximum extinction
angle lies in the acute angle and is much smaller than in
<span class="pageno" id="Page_87">87</span>pyroxene, varying with the chemical composition from 0°–20°.
In hornblende, actinolite and tremolite 12°–20°, Fig. 58; in the
basaltic hornblende 0°–10°. The maximum extinction angle is
only obtained when the section of the crystal is parallel to the clino
pinacoid (010), varying from this angle to 0°, when the section is
parallel to the ortho pinacoid (100).</p>

<p class="c007"><em><strong>Convergent Light</strong></em>: Axial plane parallel to clino pinacoid (110),
Fig. 58. Bx<sub><em>o·</em></sub>(<span class="blackletter">c</span>) Λ <em>ć</em> = 0°–20° behind. Axial angles large
(2<em>E</em> = 77° to &gt;180°). Optical character (−). Pargasite is (+).</p>

<p class="c007"><strong>Alteration</strong>: May take place to chlorite, talc, serpentine, asbestus,
etc., depending on the chemical composition. Amphibole
frays out and becomes fibrous during alteration, and may also lose
color.</p>

<p class="c007"><strong>Distinguished from</strong>:</p>

<p class="c007">(<em>a</em>) <span class="sc">Pyroxene.</span>—By usually much stronger pleochroism in the
colored varieties, and by cleavage and extinction angle. In pyroxene
the cleavage (parallel to prism of 87° 06′) is less perfect; and
the extinction angle is much larger, varying from 36° to 54°.</p>

<p class="c007">(<em>b</em>) <span class="sc">Biotite.</span>—By the extinction in the mica being always about
parallel to the cleavage. Both have strong absorption, but biotite
shows very slight pleochroism in sections parallel to the cleavage,
and has only the one cleavage parallel to the base. Also the biotite
has lower index of refraction and generally shows uniaxial interference
figure.</p>

<p class="c007">Colorless tremolite may be distinguished from muscovite and
talc by extinction angles, relief and lower order interference colors.</p>

<p class="c007">(<em>c</em>) <span class="sc">Tourmaline.</span>—By presence of cleavage, and by the fact
that absorption is most marked about parallel to the elongation
(also parallel to cleavage lines), while in tourmaline the absorption
is strongest at right angles to the elongation.</p>

<p class="c007">(<em>d</em>) The <span class="sc">Orthorhombic Pyroxenes</span>.—By extinction angles, the
latter having parallel extinction in all sections parallel to <em>a</em>, <em>b</em> and <em>c</em>,
and by prismatic cleavage of 124° 30′. Pleochroism is strong in
the colored varieties of both species, but in amphibole it appears
more generally as a variation of the same color; while in hypersthene
a change in color is often noticed, from brownish-red to
greenish parallel to <em>ć</em> axis.</p>

<p class="c007">(<em>e</em>) <span class="sc">Sillimanite</span> and <span class="sc">Cyanite</span>.—See under the latter.</p>

<p class="c018"><span class="pageno" id="Page_88">88</span><span class="sc">Remarks</span>: Amphibole comes next to pyroxene in importance and distribution
of the dark colored ferruginous rock-forming minerals. As a rule it occurs in
rocks with a large percentage of SiO<sub>2</sub>, associated with quartz and orthoclase; while
augite generally occurs in rocks of a basic nature, associated with plagioclase and
little or no free SiO<sub>2</sub>. Furthermore amphibole contains hydroxyl and is therefore
naturally found in the deep eruptive rocks; its place being taken by augite in the
effusives. By application of heat hornblende changes to augite, while hydrochemical
processes bring about the opposite result “uralitization.”</p>

<p class="c019">Tremolite and actinolite are found in contact rocks and crystalline schists, also
as a result of the alteration of olivine into serpentine. Pargasite occurs in contact
rocks. Common green hornblende is found in the plutonic rocks (Na poor
and SiO<sub>2</sub> rich), also in contact rocks and crystalline schists (amphibolites).
Brown hornblende replaces the green variety in the basic plutonic rocks. Basaltic
hornblende is found in many effusive rocks.</p>

<p class="c019">The hornblende crystals in eruptive rocks, being among the first formed constituents,
have often suffered subsequent corrosion by the magma, giving rise to
the dark border already mentioned. The brown primary hornblende in some
rocks may be changed by a process analogous to “uralitization” into a green,
reed-like hornblende. Mechanical deformations are found in massive and schistose
rocks. Light green amphiboles, with weak pleochroism, may often be colored
intensely reddish-brown and made strongly pleochroic by heating to redness on
platinum foil. In general the amphiboles are not affected by acids. H., 5 to 6.
Sp. gr., 2.9 to 3.3.</p>

<p class="c006"><em>Glaucophane</em>, <em>Arfvedsonite</em>, etc. (Na rich amphiboles).—Occur
blue to bluish-green in color, with pleochroism and weaker double
refraction than the other amphiboles. Extinction angles vary from
4°–6° (glaucophane) to 14° (arfvedsonite). They are found in
contact rocks, crystalline schists, eclogite, etc.</p>

<p class="c007">For the rarer and less known members of the amphibole group,
resource should be had to more elaborate works.</p>

<p class="c007"><em>Uralite.</em>—Pyroxene altered to amphibole, having the outward
crystal form of pyroxene and the physical characters and cleavage
of amphibole. The change usually commences on the surface and
the uralite does not form a single compact crystal, but consists of
numerous slender columns parallel to one another. These little
columns or fibers have their <em>c</em> and [<em>=b</em>] axes parallel to the positions
of these axes in the parent mineral. The color is green and the
pleochroism weak to strong.</p>

<p class="c007">This change is called “<em>uralitization</em>” and results from hydrochemical
processes. When the alteration is not complete, portions
of the original pyroxene may be left, having all the characteristic
optical properties of this latter mineral.</p>

<p class="c007"><em>Anthophyllite</em>, the orthorhombic amphibole, with always parallel
extinction, is sometimes found in colorless to brownish, blade- to
rod-like aggregates in crystalline schists and serpentine.</p>

non-pleochroic micas. Cleavage plates of biotite are not pleochroic
unless the axial angle is large.</p>

<p class="c007"><span class="pageno" id="Page_91">91</span><em><strong>Crossed Nicols</strong></em>:</p>

<p class="c007"><em>Double Refraction.</em>—Very strong (γ − α = 0.034 to 0.058).</p>

<p class="c007"><em>Interference Colors.</em>—High order (third). May be very bright
in thin sections of the colorless micas, and at times be so high in
order as not to show any marked color tints. May not be noticeable
in sections of the colored varieties, due to absorption of parts
of the light.</p>

<p class="c007"><em>Extinction.</em>—About parallel to cleavage lines. Very small extinction
angles may be noticed in biotites. Basal sections of biotite
(the approximately hexagonal mica) usually appear isotropic.</p>

<p class="c007">Mottled appearance (like “Birds-eye” maple) characteristic,
caused by distortion of the flexible laminæ during grinding. Most
noticeable in sections inclined to cleavage and near position of
extinction.</p>

<p class="c007"><em><strong>Convergent Light</strong></em>: Axial plane<a id="r94"></a><a class="c011 pginternal" href="#f94"><sup>[94]</sup></a> and Bx<sub><em>a</em></sub>, practically at right
angles to basal cleavage; therefore cleavage plates always show
well defined interference figures, generally biaxial in character.
The axial angles vary greatly, being usually small for biotite and
phlogopite (may appear uniaxial) and large for muscovite (2<em>E</em> = 55°
to 90°). Optical character for all micas (−).</p>

<p class="c007"><strong>Alteration</strong>: Biotites decompose quite easily, lose color and may
become completely bleached, which appears to be due to a leaching
out of the iron. May also alter to green chlorite, with a fraying
out of the mica and a change to chloritic structure.</p>

<p class="c007">Phlogopites may alter to fibrous, scaly masses, apparently chiefly
talc. “Sagenite” webs of rutile may accompany the alteration.</p>

<p class="c007">Muscovites are characterized by their freshness, and do not seem
to suffer from weathering.</p>

<p class="c007"><strong>Distinguished from</strong>:</p>

<p class="c007">(<em>a</em>) <span class="sc">Hornblende.</span>—Magnesium mica has extinction about parallel
to the cleavage, while hornblende may have extinction angles
of from 0° to 20°. Both have strong absorption, but biotite shows
very slight pleochroism in basal sections, which also give approximately
uniaxial interference figures in convergent light.</p>

<p class="c007">(<em>b</em>) <span class="sc">Tourmaline.</span>—Magnesium mica shreds show absorption
parallel to elongation, while in tourmaline the absorption is at right
<span class="pageno" id="Page_92">92</span>angles to elongation. There is also an absence of cleavage in
tourmaline.</p>

<p class="c007">(<em>c</em>) <span class="sc">Chlorite.</span>—By strong double refraction, the very high
order colors, however, being often not noticed. Chlorite also
shows aggregate structure and is almost always greenish in color.</p>

<p class="c007">(<em>d</em>) <span class="sc">Talc.</span>—White mica by large axial angle of scales in convergent
light and by micro-chemical tests. The distinction may
be very difficult.</p>

<p class="c018"><span class="sc">Remarks</span>: Muscovite is a rare primary mineral in eruptive rocks, except in two-mica
granite, etc. As a secondary mineral it occurs in dense scaly aggregates or
as pseudomorphs after feldspar, nephelite, etc. It is frequent in crystalline
schists and is probably also the mica in amphibolite and eclogite. Phlogopite is
found chiefly in contact metamorphic limestone; and may be distinguished from
muscovite by nearly uniaxial character and less sharp cleavage. Biotite is much
more widely distributed, occurring especially in eruptive rocks, crystalline schists
and contact rocks.</p>

<p class="c019">Chemical corrosion occurs in original biotite of porphyritic rocks, producing a
“resorption border” of augite and magnetite. Mechanical deformations, producing
bending and slipping along “gliding” planes (oblique to cleavage), are
common to all varieties of mica and may produce change to chlorite. The muscovites,
together with the feldspars, are the most characteristic minerals of
dynamo metamorphic origin. Biotites and phlogopites are attacked by sulphuric
acid at high temperatures. Muscovite is but slightly attacked by acids. H., 2
to 3. Sp. gr., 2.7 to 3.2. The specific gravity separation between the micas is
difficult on account of the scaly nature of the minerals.</p>

<p class="c006">Other micas occur, some being alteration products of those
already described. Among these may be mentioned:</p>

<p class="c007"><em>Lithia Mica.</em>—Both light and dark colored, occurring in granitic
rocks and often only distinguished chemically from muscovite and
biotite.</p>

<p class="c007"><em>Damourite</em> (<em>Sericite</em>) (hydrous K mica).—A secondary product
usually in colorless, fine scaly aggregates in phillites, sericite-schists,
etc.</p>

<p class="c007"><strong>Usual Appearance in Sections</strong>: Minute, scaly aggregates, which
may incline to radial grouping; or in minute grains as a pigment
(veridite) in other minerals.</p>

<p class="c007"><em>Twinning.</em>—May be seen as in mica.</p>

<p class="c007"><span class="pageno" id="Page_93">93</span><em>Color.</em>—Generally green, varying from greenish white to dark
green, rarely colorless or red.</p>

<p class="c007"><em>Index of Refraction.</em>—<em>n′</em> = 1.567 to 1.589 (α = 1.560 to 1.585,
γ = 1.571 to 1.596), hence no marked relief and only slightly rough

<p class="c007"><em>Cleavage.</em>—Like mica, very perfect; parallel to flat face, which

<p class="c007"><strong>Polarized Light</strong>:</p>

<p class="c007"><em>Pleochroism.</em>—In green and yellow tints (green ∥ cleavage),
being more marked in dark colored varieties. Basal sections are
non-pleochroic, the mineral being practically uniaxial. Pleochroic
halos may be seen.</p>

<p class="c007"><em><strong>Crossed Nicols</strong></em>:</p>

<p class="c007"><em>Double Refraction.</em>—Generally very weak (γ − α = 0.001 to
0.011).</p>

<p class="c007"><em>Interference Colors.</em>—Very low first order, gray or white, at
times scarcely noticed. Anomalous colors, however, often seen
(deep blue or brown.)</p>

<p class="c007"><em>Extinction.</em>—Plates parallel to cleavage generally appear isotropic
or only show faint color. In other sections extinction is
apparently parallel to the cleavage in the uniaxial type, but extinction
angles may be noticed when type is biaxial. Complete extinction
may not be noticed, due to aggregate structure.</p>

<p class="c007"><em><strong>Convergent Light</strong></em>: Plates parallel to cleavage show, at times,
an indistinct interference cross, which may open into two hyperbolas,
indicating biaxial nature of crystallization. Ax. pl. ∥ (010);
Bx<sub><em>a</em></sub>. Λ <em>ć</em> = 0° to 15°; 2<em>E</em> variable. Optical character (±).</p>

<p class="c007"><strong>Distinguished from</strong>: <span class="sc">Serpentine</span>.—By general green color (serpentine,
with exception of Fe rich variety, is colorless), pleochroism
and frequent anomalous interference colors; but the distinction
between these two minerals may be very difficult. Chlorite may
resemble decomposed or green mica (mica has, however, strong
double refraction). The different species in the chlorite group
cannot usually be distinguished in rocks.</p>

<p class="c018"><span class="sc">Remarks</span>: The chlorites are essentially secondary minerals, derived from the
aluminous silicates, biotite, augite, garnet, feldspar, etc. They are found abundantly
in chlorite-schists, contact rocks, etc., and as pigment (veridite) in altered
eruptive rocks. May occur as a primary constituent of eruptive rocks, often
<span class="pageno" id="Page_94">94</span>in parallel growth with biotite. Chlorides are acted on by hot hydrochloric acid,
and decomposed easily by sulphuric acid. H., 2 to 3. Sp. gr., 2.6 to 2.96. A
thin section heated to redness on platinum foil loses water and becomes opaque.
Ferruginous varieties are turned reddish-brown to black by heating (serpentine,
as it contains less iron, may give negative results with this test).</p>

<p class="c006"><em>Delessite.</em>—Found in sphærulites, filling cavities in amygdaloidal
basic rocks, and in pseudomorphs. It appears to be much altered
to other minerals.</p>

account of their bearing on the systematic classification of rocks. Orthoclase is
found as an essential constituent in the more acid plutonic and older volcanic
rocks, as granite, syenite, trachyte, porphyry, and also in gneiss, crystalline schists,
more seldom in contact rocks and subordinate in clastic rocks.</p>

the twinning appearing between crossed nicols as a series of dark

twin lamellæ are parallel to brachy pinacoid (010), hence not
observed in sections parallel to this pinacoid. The lamellæ may
appear irregular and interrupted, and seem to be broader in
the basic than in the acid series. When this twinning fails, however,
as in the basic plagioclases in certain metamorphic rocks,
the determination becomes very difficult. In some cases polysynthetic
twinning, after both <em>Albite</em> and <em>Pericline</em> laws, may
take place at the same time, giving rise to a structure somewhat
similar to that of microcline, Fig. 72. In addition the polysynthetic

<p class="c014">The correct determination of the particular plagioclase is of the
greatest importance in the classification of rocks, and it is no longer
sufficient to simply determine the feldspar as either orthoclase or
plagioclase.</p>

<p class="c007">A quantitative analysis of isolated material would lead most
surely to the desired result, but has many objections.</p>

<p class="c007">Modern optical methods now permit of a very accurate and convenient
determination under ordinary circumstances. But of
course these methods involve a knowledge of the approximate
orientation of the section tested. When this section is not a definite
cleavage fragment, its orientation can best be determined by
convergent light tests.</p>

<p class="c007">Only an outline of these methods can be here given, and reference

</div>

<p class="c007"><span class="pageno" id="Page_111">111</span>The section to be tested should be in the zone perpendicular to
(010). Such sections show sharp boundary lines between the
twin lamellæ and, between crossed nicols, the <em>Albite</em> lamellæ show
the same interference color when the trace of (010) is parallel to
the cross-wires of the ocular, and also in the 45° position the
lamellæ are the same color and no dividing lines show. The two
parts of the <em>Carlsbad</em> twin exhibit different interference colors in
the 45° position, this difference being more marked as the composition
approaches that of Anorthite. The extinction angles are
measured from the trace of the <em>Albite</em> twinning plane (010), paying
regard to the + and − signs, and the <em>concurrent series</em> of angles
are to be obtained from the two parts of the <em>Carlsbad</em> twin. The
range of these angles (for four type compositions, Ab, Ab<sub>4</sub>An<sub>1</sub>,
Ab<sub>1</sub>An<sub>1</sub> and An) is given in the accompanying diagram for all
positions of the section in the zone normal to (010).</p>

<p class="c007">In the curves of this diagram (Fig. 74) the vertical distances
are the extinction angles for every ten degrees measured from the
trace of the <em>Albite</em> twinning plane, and the horizontal distances
represent varying positions of the section in the zone normal to
(010) for every ten degrees of rotation from the position ∥ to the
edge (100)(010) (that is ∥ <em>ć</em> axis), through a revolution of 180°
to again ∥ to the same position. The concurrent angles in one
part of a <em>Carlsbad</em> twin are represented by a heavy line and in the
other part by a broken line. It will be observed that the difference
between these concurrent angles is very small in Albite (3°) and
increases markedly towards Anorthite (60°).</p>

leads to the characteristic “lattice structure,” the alteration to chrysotile to “mesh

surface and cracks, producing fibres of chrysotile, which stand at right angles to
these edges and cracks. As serpentinization proceeds new cracks form, due to
increase in volume, and the process may continue until complete pseudomorphism
takes place. When this subsequent serpentinization of the meshes takes place
the resulting serpentine may appear almost isotropic<a id="r123"></a><a class="c011 pginternal" href="#f123"><sup>[123]</sup></a> and is certainly different

</div>

<p class="c006">The methods described will be those used in making rock sections.
The general principles involved are the same for both rock
and crystal sections; although more difficulties are encountered
in making the latter, due to the sections being required in some
definite direction or of some precise thickness, or on account of
the possibly fragile or brittle character of the crystals.</p>

<p class="c007">In the case of rock sections any section, taken “at will”
through the rock, will generally do.</p>

<h3 class="c013">Cutting and Grinding Machines.<a id="r125"></a><a class="c011 pginternal" href="#f125"><sup>[125]</sup></a></h3>

<p class="c014">Many different kinds are used, the power being furnished by
steam, electric motor<a id="r126"></a><a class="c011 pginternal" href="#f126"><sup>[126]</sup></a> or by the hand or foot.</p>

<p class="c007">The chip or fragment of rock to be sliced should be comparatively
small in size, and may be cut by either a vertical diamond saw
or by a horizontal emery-disc. The fragment is held
in position by suitable guides. The moistened emery can be kept
in the tray and fed to the disc by a spoon or some other device.
Diamond saws are only needed in the case of hard rocks.</p>

<p class="c007">For cutting sections of crystals in definite directions a form of
small hand apparatus<a id="r127"></a><a class="c011 pginternal" href="#f127"><sup>[127]</sup></a> is shown in Fig. 76.</p>

<p class="c007">This cut shows how the plate, to which the crystal is cemented,
can be given definite rotation in two directions. The simpler
crystal holder, appearing loose on the stand, may be used when a
section is required parallel to the face of the crystal cemented to
the holder.</p>

<p class="c007"><span class="pageno" id="Page_118">118</span>In these machines the cutting is done with rotating saws of
sheet-tin, usually charged with either diamond dust or emery.</p>

<div class="figcenter id005">
<img alt="" class="ig001" src="images/image118.jpg" id="img_images_image118.jpg">
<div class="ic002">
<p><span class="sc">Fig. 76.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="c007">In the case of a very small crystal a section, parallel to any desired
face, can be obtained by cementing this face to a suitable
frame or holder and grinding down by hand on a glass plate with
emery, the final polish being given with rouge. When the section
required is not parallel to a crystallographic face or cleavage
it must be verified geometrically with reference to other faces. If
the crystals are soluble in water, some other liquid, as α bromnaphthalin
or benzine, must be used in grinding; and very fragile
crystals are rubbed down on a ground glass plate without emery
or rouge, simply using bromnaphthalin or some other appropriate
liquid.</p>

<p class="c007">When sections of a crystal are desired with strictly parallel faces,
the form of grinding apparatus shown in Fig. 77 can be used.</p>

<p class="c007">This apparatus consists of a cylinder, held within a suitable
<span class="pageno" id="Page_119">119</span>frame supported on three set-screws, <em>a<sub>1</sub></em>, <em>a<sub>2</sub></em> and <em>a<sub>3</sub></em>, of hard steel.
The lower surface of the frame and consequently the bottom of the
cylinder can be adjusted by the wedge <em>k</em> and the set-screws so that
it is exactly parallel to the grinding surface of the glass plate.
The crystal to be ground down, <em>p</em>, is cemented to the bottom of
the cylinder, and the whole apparatus rubbed over the grinding
surface of the plate. The pressure of the hand on the upper part
of the cylinder regulates the pressure of the crystal on the grinding
surface. In this way a surface is obtained which is exactly
parallel to the surface cemented to the cylinder.</p>

<div class="figcenter id005">
<img alt="" class="ig001" src="images/image119.jpg" id="img_images_image119.jpg">
<div class="ic002">
<p><span class="sc">Fig. 77.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="c007">Sections of definite thickness can also be obtained by using this
apparatus; for the adjustments with the wedge <em>k</em> may be so arranged
that, when the stop <em>t</em> in the cylinder has reached the bottom
of the slot in the frame, the lower surface of the cylinder will
be the required distance from the grinding surface of the glass
plate. The wedge is graduated so that the value of one division
on the sloping top is known in <em>mm.</em> of vertical distance.</p>

<h3 class="c013">Saws.</h3>

<p class="c014">Saws,<a id="r128"></a><a class="c011 pginternal" href="#f128"><sup>[128]</sup></a> of about six inches in diameter made from ¹⁄₃₆ inch sheet-tin,
are convenient for general work, and may be charged with
diamond dust by the operator as follows:<a id="r129"></a><a class="c011 pginternal" href="#f129"><sup>[129]</sup></a> Crush one or two
<span class="pageno" id="Page_120">120</span>carats of rough crystals of diamond-bort in a small steel mortar
to about the condition of fine sand, care being taken not to reduce
the diamond to powder. Transfer the dust to a piece of flat iron
and, after collecting it in a heap, moisten with a drop of oil. The
cutting edge of the tin disk must now be prepared by making a
series of incisions (¹⁄₁₆ inch deep) on the outer margin. This can
be done by striking the disk with a sharp, thin knife edge. The
larger the number of incisions and the closer they are together the
better. Charging the saw is accomplished by gently hammering
the edge against the iron plate, upon which is the paste of diamond
dust and oil. The disk must be slowly rotated during this
charging process, which should be continued until all portions of
the edge have been gone over two or three times.</p>

<p class="c007">Instead of charging with diamond dust the saws may be used
with emery. The edges of the saws should first be “upset,” as
just described, and then while rotating charged with emery. The
emery in the state of mud can be applied with the thumb and
fingers, or the saw can be allowed to pass through a tray of emery
mud. The finer grades of emery (Nos. 100 to 120) should be used.</p>

<p class="c007">The method of mounting saws, of course, depends on the way
the saws and spindles are constructed. It is well, however, to
have the hole in the center of the saw-disk sufficiently large to
allow of adjustment for accurate centering.</p>

<h3 class="c013">Cutting.</h3>

<p class="c014">During the process of cutting a lubricant must be used on the
saw. Petroleum has been recommended by some, but water seems
to be the most used. Holding a piece of soap against the cutting
edge will also reduce friction. It is convenient to carry the
water to the saw through a very small lead pipe, which permits of
easy adjustment, so that the water can be delivered at just the right
spot, the flow of water, of course, being regulated by a stop-cock.</p>

<p class="c007">Another method for cutting sections is used by the U. S. Geological
Survey at Washington, D. C. The apparatus consists of
an endless wire of soft iron, about ³⁄₃₂ inch in diameter, revolving
over two pulleys or wheels, one of which is driven by steam-power.
The wire is charged by dipping the fingers in water,
taking up a little fine (120 grade) emery and holding the fingers
<span class="pageno" id="Page_121">121</span>against the wire above the section. The wire revolves so as to cut
downwards, thus carrying with it the emery taken from the fingers.</p>

<p class="c007">In cutting sections the thickness, of course, depends on the
character of the rock; the more porous and fragile the rock the
thicker the section should be made, an ordinary section being
about as thick as a silver quarter of a dollar.</p>

<p class="c007">Very often by skill and practice a suitably shaped chip or fragment
can be detached from the specimen with a hammer or with a
hammer and cleavage chisels, thus avoiding the delay and trouble
involved in the use of the section cutter.</p>

<h3 class="c013">Grinding Plates or Laps.</h3>

<p class="c014">Copper laps, about 7–8 inches in diameter and ½ inch thick,
seem to be best for general purposes; although laps made of lead
or cast iron are also used. A lead lap, being soft, holds the emery
well and thus hastens the grinding away of the section; but at the
same time its own smooth surface is soon destroyed. A cast iron
lap is much harder and retains its smooth surface better, but does
not hold the emery so well and therefore retards the process of
grinding. Copper, being intermediate in hardness between lead
and iron, seems to combine the advantages of both.</p>

<p class="c007">It is always good practice to have at least two laps, one for the
preliminary grinding with coarse emery and the other for the final
grinding with the finest grades of emery. In this way one lap is
always kept with a smooth surface, making it possible to give a
uniform, plane finish to the section.</p>

<p class="c007">The surface of the laps should not be exactly plane, but turned
or finished so as to be a little higher (¹⁄₃₂ of an inch for diameter of
8 inches) at the axis than at the periphery; the idea being to compensate
for the more rapid abrasive action towards the periphery.</p>

<h3 class="c013">Cementing.</h3>

<p class="c014">For grinding down to a proper thinness for transparency it is
necessary to <em>cement</em> the fragment of rock to a holder, which consists
of a small piece of plate-glass about ⅛ inch thick. If the
piece of rock has been cut by a good diamond saw the surface
will be comparatively smooth and uniform, and may only need
polishing (described under <em>grinding</em>) before cementing. When,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_122">122</span>however, the piece of rock is in the shape of a chip or rough fragment
it is first necessary to prepare a smooth ground surface on
one side (described under <em>grinding</em>) before it can be cemented to
the glass holder.</p>

<p class="c007">The pieces of plate-glass used should be free from flaws, bubbles
or anything tending to destroy uniformity of surface, and should
be a little larger than the chips and slices of rock for which they
are to act as holders. Hardened Canada balsam, or better yet, a
cement made of a mixture of shellac and Venice turpentine,<a id="r130"></a><a class="c011 pginternal" href="#f130"><sup>[130]</sup></a>
should be used.</p>

<p class="c007">The process of cementing is carried on as follows: Heat the
glass support over an alcohol lamp or a Bunsen burner, place it on
a good non-conductor of heat, as a piece of wood, and rub it with
a stick of the cement until a sufficient quantity has been melted
off. The piece of rock should then be treated in the same manner,
applying the cement to the smooth finished portion. Care must
be taken that neither the glass nor rock preparation are heated too
much, as this would cause the cement to smoke or bubble. After
placing the rock preparation and plate together, use quite a little
pressure in order to drive out all superfluous cement. Examine
now, through the glass, the contact surface and see that it is entirely
free from bubbles, etc.</p>

<p class="c007">Bubbles are usually caused by overheating of the parts before
cementing. If only very few bubbles are seen, they may generally
be removed by moving the rock preparation rapidly back and
forth over the glass plate. If the bubbles are numerous or cannot
be removed in the manner just described, the rock preparation
must be separated from the glass plate and the cementing done
over again.</p>

<p class="c007">Bubbles must <em>not</em> be allowed to remain, as the portions of the
rock over them, not having any cement backing, are ground away
leaving holes in the section.</p>

<p class="c014">After the rock preparation has been cemented to its glass holder
it is ready for the grinding process, for which are used horizontal
laps, mounted on a vertical spindle in the tray <em>T</em>, Fig. 76. The
copper lap for the first grinding is put in place, and, after it has
commenced to rotate, is charged with emery and water. This
can conveniently be done by dropping on the emery and water,
either with the fingers or with a small bunch of rags at the end of
a stick. A large camel’s hair brush may be used for putting on
the finest emery. The emery is distributed over the rotating lap
by the motion of the rock preparation during grinding. The kind
of emery used for this first grinding depends somewhat on the
character of the rock section. If the section is composed of a hard,
compact, fine grained rock, the first emery used may be quite
coarse; the coarser the emery the more rapid being the grinding
down. For rough, quick work, Nos. 80 to 100 emery can be
used until the section becomes quite thin; then, still using the
same lap, substitute the finest corn emery (next coarsest to flour
emery) and continue grinding until the section becomes quite
translucent. The lap must then be changed, and the grinding
finished with the finest emery dust.</p>

<p class="c007">Too great care cannot be given to cleanliness while doing this
sort of work. A single grain of coarse emery, getting on the lap
or section during the final grinding, will often spoil the whole
work by making a bad scratch. In grinding down the section,
great care must be taken to see that the grinding surface is kept
parallel to the surface cemented to the glass. The section is firmly
pressed against the lap by means of two or three fingers, depending
on its size, and uniform pressure should be maintained over all
parts.</p>

<p class="c007">The section should be examined frequently, and if it is noticed
that one part is thicker than another, place the section on the lap
so that the thicker part is towards the periphery, and put a little
more pressure upon this part. Gutting or grooving the copper
laps is prevented by moving the section from center to periphery
and back, at the same time giving to it a slight rotary motion. It
is best to have the lap revolve from right to left (in the opposite
way from the hands of a watch), as, holding the section on the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_124">124</span>right side of the lap, it is easier to keep it in place by a pulling
motion rather than by pushing it against the motion of the lap.
In the final stages of grinding and polishing great precaution must
be exercised, as one or two turns too many of the lap will often
tear away a large part of the very thin section. The section should
be frequently examined, by transmitted light, with a small, low power
microscope, a drop of water or oil being put on the section
to render it more transparent. If the section is thick and fastened
to the plate-glass with a good deal of cement, it will be found convenient,
after the section has been ground quite thin, to remove
most of this cement from around its edges. If this is not done,
it may delay the final work of grinding down. A good rock section
should be made so thin that all the transparent and translucent
component minerals can be examined and studied. Well made
rock sections average in thickness from 0.03 to 0.05 <em>mm.</em> The
last part of the final grinding and polishing can be done by the
hand on a ground glass plate, using the finest emery dust or rouge
and water.</p>

<p class="c007">Flour emery may also be used entirely for grinding, and the
finest emery dust for polishing. The finer emery makes better
work, although it takes more time, and is much safer for porous or
brittle sections, as the danger of tearing away pieces of the section
is avoided. In the case of a porous or decomposed rock it is well
before grinding to boil the section in Canada balsam or other
equivalent material so as to fill all the pores and interstices, thus
making the section more compact and less liable to chip away.
Sometimes it may even be best before grinding to mount the section
on its permanent glass slide, so that when it has been ground
thin enough the cover can be put on without running any risk in
transferring the section. The only objection is that the glass slide
may be a little scratched by the emery.</p>

<h3 class="c013">Mounting.</h3>

<p class="c014">When the section is sufficiently thin and has a smooth uniform
surface it is ready to be transferred and mounted upon its permanent
glass slide. The glass plate, which has held the section during
the grinding, is gently heated, and, as soon as the cement begins
to soften, the section is very gently pushed off into a shallow
<span class="pageno" id="Page_125">125</span>cup or evaporating dish containing turpentine or alcohol. Turpentine
is convenient for general use, because common alcohol (on
account of the water it contains) unites with the shellac to form a
kind of white pasty substance, which is sometimes hard to remove
from the section. The section should be carefully cleaned in the
turpentine or alcohol bath by means of fine camel’s hair brushes.
A section-lifter, made from a piece of broad, flat watch-spring fastened
to a small handle, is then gently placed under the section,
which is lifted out of the bath in an inclined position so as to allow
the liquid to drain off. If a drop still adheres it can be removed
by touching it gently with the finger.</p>

<p class="c007">The section is now placed in a tray, upon a piece of white, unglazed
paper, so that it may thoroughly dry; after which process
it is transferred to a glass slide, and, if necessary, its rough edges
chipped off with a knife.</p>

<p class="c007">If the section is very large, and it is desired to mount it in two
pieces, it can easily be divided by holding one half tightly between
two glass slides and gently bending the other half with the fingers.
The fracture will take place along the edges of the glass slides.</p>

<p class="c007">A mixture of gum damar and benzole is recommended for
mounting, the claim being made that gum damar does not turn
yellow with age, whereas Canada balsam may do so. Two solutions
of gum damar and benzole are used. One very thin, about the
consistency of water, the other quite thick, about the consistency
of mucilage. Both solutions are prepared by dissolving the gum
damar in benzole and filtering through a linen or silk rag. If the
solution is too thin it can be thickened by placing the bottle in a
warm place and allowing the excess of benzole to evaporate, or if
too thick, more benzole can be added. It is convenient to keep
the solutions in short glass bottles, with wide necks and glass covers
instead of corks. The solutions can be applied with glass rods.</p>

<p class="c007">When the section is all ready for its final mounting it is carefully
centered with a coarse needle on the glass slide,<a id="r131"></a><a class="c011 pginternal" href="#f131"><sup>[131]</sup></a> and a drop
of the thin solution placed at the edge of the section. Capillary
attraction will cause it to flow over the glass slide under the section,
and while it is soft the section can be again adjusted in place.
<span class="pageno" id="Page_126">126</span>The slide is then placed in a cool, dust proof place and allowed to
stand for about twelve hours, when the cement will be set and the
section held firmly in place. The upper surface of the section is
then washed with a drop of benzine, and as much as may be
necessary of the thick mounting solution placed upon it with a
glass rod. A cover of glass of the right size is gently heated and
placed in position over the section. Care must be taken not to
have the cover too hot, as it would cause bubbles to form in the
cement. It is also best to rest one edge of the cover on the cement
first, and then lower it gently so as to prevent air bubbles from
being included. The cover is adjusted and then held firmly in
position by means of a mounting clamp, which presses out all superfluous
cement. If a few small bubbles remain near the edges they
may be let alone, as they will generally work out by themselves in
time. Sometimes a large bubble can be worked out by local pressure
with the finger and gentle heating with a small iron rod. If
the mounting is unsatisfactory the cover should be removed by
heating, the old cement washed off with a camel’s hair brush and
benzole, and a fresh cover put on. After the cement has set, the
clamp may be removed, but the slide should be left for 24 hours,
or longer if necessary, until the cement is quite hard. This takes
longer in hot than in cold weather.</p>

<p class="c007">The advantage of using two solutions for mounting is that the
section is firmly held in place on the glass slide while the cover is
being placed over it; there is thus no slipping or sliding of the
section, and when the cover is adjusted in place the work is well
finished and the section still in the centre of the slide.</p>

<p class="c007">Canada balsam, or balsam in xylol, are also often used for
mounting. The advantage of the latter being its quick drying or
“setting.”</p>

<h3 class="c013">Cleaning and Finishing.</h3>

<p class="c014">When the cement has set the superfluous part is singed by
means of a small hot iron rod. Care must be taken not to use too
large a rod or to have it too hot, as the cement under the cover
might then soften and allow the cover to slip or air bubbles to
form. The singeing drives off the more volatile part of the cement,
leaving only a brittle residue, which can be easily scraped off with
a knife. In some cases it may be necessary to singe and scrape
<span class="pageno" id="Page_127">127</span>twice. The final cleaning is done with a soft rag and benzole.
The slides are now ready to be marked, either with a diamond
pencil or with pasted labels.</p>

  <h2 class="c005">CHAPTER VI.<br> <span class="c012"><span class="sc">Chemical and Mechanical Tests.</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p class="c006">These tests may be necessary to confirm an optical determination
or to assist in the differentiation of the closely related species
of a group, as for example, the different plagioclases in the feldspar
group. They may also be useful in the case of opaque substances.</p>

<p class="c007">The ordinary chemical methods employed in mineral analyses
are often not applicable, on account of the minute size of the mineral
under investigation and the lack of sharpness in the reactions.
Those methods<a id="r132"></a><a class="c011 pginternal" href="#f132"><sup>[132]</sup></a> are to be preferred which produce crystallizations
independent of the relative proportions of the materials taking
part in the reaction and also of the physical conditions invoked.</p>

<p class="c007">The tests can be made either on the crystal in a rock section or
on the isolated crystal or fragment, the latter method being preferable
when possible.</p>

<h3 class="c013"> <span class="sc">Chemical Tests Made on Crystal in Section.</span></h3>

<p class="c014">The part of the section to be tested must be prepared by thorough
washing with alcohol and benzole to remove all traces of
balsam. If the section is covered, the cover-glass can be cut
across with a diamond, and, after heating, the desired portion removed
with a knife edge. Any portion of a section can be isolated
by surrounding it with a rim of viscous balsam or by putting on a
new cover-glass, in which a small hole has been made.<a id="r133"></a><a class="c011 pginternal" href="#f133"><sup>[133]</sup></a> This hole
can be accurately adjusted over the special portion of the section
and the balsam removed by alcohol and benzole.</p>

<p class="c007">The treatment of rock sections with ordinary acids, such as
hydrochloric, may show the presence of easily soluble minerals<a id="r134"></a><a class="c011 pginternal" href="#f134"><sup>[134]</sup></a>
and carbonates, or distinguish silicates that are soluble with jelly,
or produce etched figures on the minerals.</p>

<p class="c007"><span class="pageno" id="Page_130">130</span><em>Test for Carbonates.</em> When only present in very minute grains
the test can be made as follows: Cover the rock section with a drop
of water and a cover-glass, then allow a drop of acid to slowly
diffuse through the water film. The glass cover will prevent the
escape of the gas bubbles<a id="r135"></a><a class="c011 pginternal" href="#f135"><sup>[135]</sup></a> which will thus surely be detected.</p>

<p class="c007">If necessary the section can be warmed by heating the projecting
part of a suitable stand, placed under the section on the stage
of the microscope.</p>

<p class="c007"><em>Test for Gelatinizing Silica.</em> Cover the carefully cleansed section
with a little dilute acid (commonly hydrochloric) and let stand.
If too much acid is used the resultant gelatin will spread over the
whole section and not appear simply on the gelatinizing silicate.
Warm the section, if necessary, and finally rinse off the remaining
acid thoroughly with water. Do not allow the action of the acid
to continue too long, as it is desirable to obtain only a very thin
film of gelatinous silica over the minerals attacked, so that the
optical tests can still be made on these minerals. If after the first
trial the action has not been pronounced enough, the test should
be repeated.</p>

<p class="c007">The transparent film of gelatinous silica is made more visible
by covering the section with a drop of water, containing a dilute
solution of fuchsine. After standing for some time the section
should be washed, when only those portions covered by the gelatinous
film will show the color stain.</p>

<h3 class="c013"> <span class="sc">Etched Figures.</span><a id="r136"></a><a class="c011 pginternal" href="#f136"><sup>[136]</sup></a></h3>

<p class="c014">The results of etching tests can not be regarded as very satisfactory
in the case of sections of minerals in rock sections, on
account of doubt as to the crystallographic orientation of these
sections.</p>

<p class="c007">The symmetry of the etched figures depends essentially on the
relation of the crystal faces on which they are obtained to the
planes of symmetry.</p>

<p class="c007"><span class="pageno" id="Page_131">131</span>The forms of the etched figures differ on the same face of a mineral,
depending on the reagent used, but their degree of symmetry
is independent of the reagent or its degree of concentration. The
sharpest figures are produced on crystal and cleavage faces, the
figures being less perfect on artificially prepared faces, even when
polished. The etching tests may, however, be tried to prove the
presence of twinning, or to distinguish between minerals of similar
appearance but belonging to different systems.<a id="r137"></a><a class="c011 pginternal" href="#f137"><sup>[137]</sup></a></p>

<p class="c007">Various acids or alkalies are used to produce the etched figures,
depending on the mineral to be tested. Different factors influence
the formation of good etched figures, and that method must be used
which seems to give most satisfactory results in the given case.
The action of the reagent should be sufficiently pronounced to
develop clearly the etched figures; at the same time the tests must
be stopped before the solvent action has been too powerful.<a id="r138"></a><a class="c011 pginternal" href="#f138"><sup>[138]</sup></a> After
treatment for etching the section should be thoroughly washed and
examined in some fluid of weak refraction (with <em>n</em> lower than that
of the crystal section), such as water or air.<a id="r139"></a><a class="c011 pginternal" href="#f139"><sup>[139]</sup></a> The objective, of
course, must be focused on the surface of the section.</p>

<h3 class="c013"> <span class="sc">Heating Sections to Redness.</span><a id="r140"></a><a class="c011 pginternal" href="#f140"><sup>[140]</sup></a></h3>

<p class="c014">The part of the section to be tested must be removed from the
object glass, carefully cleansed of balsam, and held on platinum
foil in the oxidizing blowpipe flame. After the test the fragment
used may be remounted in Canada balsam for study.</p>

<p class="c007">As a result of heating:</p>

<p class="c007">Colorless, hydrous minerals (zeolites and chlorites) become
cloudy in appearance.</p>

<p class="c007">Colorless silicates, containing protoxide of iron (as olivine, or
faintly colored pyroxene or amphibole), become red or reddish-brown.</p>

<p class="c007"><span class="pageno" id="Page_132">132</span>Colored minerals may change their color, chloritic substances
becoming brown or black if heated enough.</p>

<p class="c007">Hornblende always becomes pleochroic, and olivine sometimes
becomes so.</p>

<p class="c007">Members of the sodalite group may be turned blue, if not already
of that color.</p>

<p class="c007">The dichroism (yellow to blue) of almost colorless iolite may be
developed.</p>

<p class="c007">Carbonaceous particles may be distinguished from the iron oxides
by being consumed.<a id="r141"></a><a class="c011 pginternal" href="#f141"><sup>[141]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class="c013"> <span class="sc">Methods of Isolating Crystals or Mineral Fragments for Testing.</span><a id="r142"></a><a class="c011 pginternal" href="#f142"><sup>[142]</sup></a></h3>

<p class="c014">For the application of these methods the rock or aggregate of
minerals should be reduced to homogeneous<a id="r143"></a><a class="c011 pginternal" href="#f143"><sup>[143]</sup></a> grains of uniform
size (preferably crystals or cleavages) and not to powder. This is
best done by pounding in a metal mortar, avoiding all grinding
motion.</p>

<p class="c007">The separations required may be made by specific gravity solutions
or magnetic methods, alone or combined; and in some cases
may be assisted by chemical action.</p>

<p class="c007">When other methods fail it may be necessary to separate single
grains from a mixture by hand. A grooved piece of plate-glass,
passed beneath the objective of the microscope, will be found useful.
The desired grains in this groove can be picked out by means
of a piece of fine waxed thread or a fine pointed stick moistened at
the end.</p>

<p class="c007">The <em>hardness</em> of the homogeneous grains may be obtained by
pressing them firmly into the end of a lead stamp or holder and
trying the effect of scratching upon the faces of minerals of known
hardness.</p>

<p class="c007"><span class="pageno" id="Page_133">133</span><em>Specific Gravity Separation.</em><a id="r144"></a><a class="c011 pginternal" href="#f144"><sup>[144]</sup></a> Accomplished by use of fluids of
different specific gravity. These fluids can be made specifically
lighter by dilution, and hence the fragments will fall to the bottom
in order of decreasing density. Dilution of the heavy solutions to
any specific gravity may be affected empirically until the solution
will just suspend a fragment of a mineral having the desired specific
gravity; or the exact specific gravity of the solution may be
determined by the Westphal balance.</p>

<p class="c007">The following <em>indicators</em> may be employed to determine the
limits of the specific gravity of the solution to be used for separation
purposes (V. Goldschmidt):</p>

<p class="c007">Possible chemical action between the minerals and heavy solutions
must not be overlooked in this method of separation.</p>

<p class="c007">The funnel-shaped apparatus for these separations must be so
arranged, with stop-cocks, etc., that the heavier material collected
at the bottom can be easily drawn off or removed at any stage of

by regulating its magnetic intensity.<a id="r146"></a><a class="c011 pginternal" href="#f146"><sup>[146]</sup></a></p>

<p class="c007"><em>Separation by Chemical Means.</em> Very many different methods
may be used, depending on the nature of the work to be accomplished;
but they are generally only reliable in the hands of a good
chemist. The material should be in the state of fine powder.</p>

<p class="c007">As an example may be mentioned the treatment with pure
concentrated HFl, by which the minerals of a rock are attacked
in a certain sequence, the feldspars and related minerals first, then
the quartz and finally the ferro-magnesium silicates, such as amphibole,
pyroxene, olivine, etc.</p>

<h3 class="c013"> <span class="sc">Micro-Chemical Reactions.</span></h3>

<p class="c014">The first requisite is to bring the substance to be investigated
into solution. This can be done in the case of non-silicates by the
ordinary solvents, while silicates can be decomposed and investigated
either by the methods of Borichy or Behrens. Both methods
rest upon the recognition of the forms, etc., of artificially produced
crystals.</p>

<p class="c007"><span class="pageno" id="Page_135">135</span>The size of a fragment for testing may vary, according to circumstances,
from that of a poppy seed to a pin head. Good results
are recorded from fragments of not more than 0.2–0.7 sq. mm.</p>

<p class="c007">The substance to be tested is placed on glass, protected by a
film of balsam, and covered with a spherical drop of the solvent,<a id="r147"></a><a class="c011 pginternal" href="#f147"><sup>[147]</sup></a>
which should be allowed to act until all the different elements
composing the sample are in solution (in the case of a very small
fragment until it has all dissolved). Transfer the solution to
another protected object glass, and, after evaporation, the crystallizations
characteristic of the different elements will be seen.</p>

<p class="c007">If the evaporation is too rapid and the crystallizations incomplete,
the residue should be redissolved in water, or a very dilute
solution of the solvent employed, transferred to a fresh glass and
allowed to recrystallize.</p>

<h3 class="c013">Borichy’s Method.<a id="r148"></a><a class="c011 pginternal" href="#f148"><sup>[148]</sup></a> (Hydrofluosilicic Acid.)</h3>

<p class="c014">This method has the advantage of simplicity of manipulation
and relative distinctness in results; but on the other hand these
results are only obtained after several hours, and the temperature
has an influence on the crystalline forms obtained. It is well to
make the tests in a temperature of about 15° C.</p>

<p class="c007">Put a spherical drop of pure hydrofluosilicic acid<a id="r149"></a><a class="c011 pginternal" href="#f149"><sup>[149]</sup></a> on the fragment
and leave it for some hours in damp air until the action has
been sufficient, then transfer it to a dry air bell-glass and allow
evaporation and crystallization to take place.</p>

<p class="c007">For the microscopic examination the objective (200–300 diams.
best for these observations) can be protected with glycerine and
a mica disc or thin cover-glass, or the drop can be all evaporated
and the crystals covered with liquid balsam and a cover-glass.</p>

<p class="c007"><em>Calcium.</em> From hydrofluosilicic solutions, monoclinic crystals
of CaSiFl<sub>6</sub> + 2H<sub>2</sub>O of various forms, generally spindle-shaped,
with not very strong double refraction. The crystals have seldom
straight-edged boundaries and are often grouped in rosettes. The
addition of dilute H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> decomposes the crystals, recrystallization
<span class="pageno" id="Page_137">137</span>yielding long prismatic crystals of gypsum (distinction from

<p class="c007">Treatment with HFl and dilute H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> (in excess), producing on

delicate test for small percentages of calcium.</p>

<p class="c007"><em>Magnesium.</em> From hydrofluosilicic solutions, rhombohedral
crystals of MgSiFl<sub>6</sub> + 6H<sub>2</sub>O with plane faces and sharp edges.
The crystals are colorless and strongly doubly refracting with
positive optical character, Fig. 81.</p>

<p class="c007">The formation of struvite crystals (NH<sub>4</sub>MgPO<sub>4</sub> + 6H<sub>2</sub>O), of
coffin-like forms, is very characteristic and takes place from very
dilute solutions (rendered alkaline) on the addition of a grain of
salt of phosphorus or a drop of sodium phosphate.</p>

<p class="c007"><em>Iron.</em> From hydrofluosilicic solutions, crystals of FeSiFl<sub>6</sub> +
6H<sub>2</sub>O, which are isomorphous with those of magnesium salts, with
the same optical characters. They may be differentiated by moistening
with potassium ferrocyanide or ammonium sulphide, in
the first case by turning blue, in the second case black.</p>

<p class="c007"><em>Aluminium.</em> From hydrofluosilicic solutions, not satisfactory
on account of the gelatinous formation.</p>

<p class="c007">When the gelatinous formation is obtained by the action of
hydrofluoric acid on an <em>aluminous silicate</em>, the staining test can be
used to distinguish between fine grains of feldspar and quartz or
iolite and quartz.</p>

<h3 class="c013">Behrens’ Method.<a id="r152"></a><a class="c011 pginternal" href="#f152"><sup>[152]</sup></a> (Hydrofluoric and Sulphuric Acids.)</h3>

<p class="c014">This method depends on common reactions that can be made
rapidly, but has the disadvantage of being rather complicated and
requiring delicate manipulation.</p>

<p class="c007">The tests are best made upon about ½ mg. of powder with
HFl (pure and fuming). As soon as the fluorides begin to dry
treat with dilute H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> and warm until white fumes of SO<sub>3</sub> appear.
In this way the HFl and SiFl<sub>4</sub> are driven off and the sulphates are
left. This part of the test can conveniently be made on a piece
of platinum foil. Add excess of water and concentrate.</p>

<p class="c007"><span class="pageno" id="Page_138">138</span>Transfer a drop to a clean object glass and, while still liquid,

<p class="c007"><em>Sodium.</em> Use sulphate of cerium and allow a small amount of
this reagent to act through a capillary pipette upon a drop of the
solution. Very small aggregates of brown crystals (size .02 mm.)
of the double sulphate of cerium and sodium are formed, which
are clearly visible with 600 diams. If potassium is present the
double sulphate of that alkali will appear in larger, grayish grains
(size .05 to .06 mm.). An excess of H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> is to be avoided.</p>

<p class="c007"><em>Calcium.</em> After a few minutes little gypsum crystals (CaSO<sub>4</sub>
+ 2H<sub>2</sub>O) will appear. In strongly acid solutions the thin acicular
crystals will be grouped in bushes or stars; in neutral solutions
the crystals will have the normal shape of selenite crystals or form
swallow-tailed twins.</p>

<p class="c007"><em>Magnesium.</em> Use salt of phosphorus dissolved in water and
allow it to mix with the solution (to which has been added ammonium
chloride and ammonia) through a capillary pipette. From a
solution containing more than 5 per cent. of magnesium are first
deposited X-shaped skeletons and rudimentary crystals of Mg.NH<sub>4</sub>.PO<sub>4</sub>
+ 6H<sub>2</sub>O. If the solution is more dilute beautiful, sharp,
hemimorphic crystals (.10 to .20 mm. in size) of the orthorhombic
<span class="pageno" id="Page_139">139</span>system will appear. These crystals often resemble the roof of
a house. The formation of the crystals is assisted by heat. Iron
and manganese phosphates yield crystals of the same type, but
the iron is separated on the addition of ammonia.</p>

<p class="c007"><em>Aluminium.</em> Use chloride of cæsium. Take a drop of the
solution, with excess of H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> driven off, and touch it with a
platinum wire that has been dipped in the melted chloride of
cæsium. Large crystals (.40-.90 mm. in size) of cæsium alum will
form, which are octahedral and cubo-octahedral in shape. Iron
does not interfere, as its crystallization would take place much
more slowly. The solution should not be too concentrated.</p>

<p class="c014">Distinction between haüynite (contains CaSO<sub>4</sub>) and noselite
(contains Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>). Treat with HCl and on evaporation the characteristic
crystals of gypsum will be seen if the mineral is haüynite.
Dilute acid should be used and as low a temperature maintained
as possible, otherwise crystals of anhydrite would form instead of
gypsum.</p>

<p class="c007">Recognition of apatite by test for phosphorus. Treat with a
drop of ammonium molybdate dissolved in HNO<sub>3</sub>. After complete
action remove the solution to a clean object glass, when after
slight warming a large number of very small yellow crystals
(rhombic dodecahedral in shape) will form. The test may be
<span class="pageno" id="Page_140">140</span>used to distinguish this mineral from nephelite, melilite and natrolite.
In the presence of soluble silica evaporate to render it insoluble
and treat again with HNO<sub>3</sub> and the reagent.</p>

  <h3 class="c013"> <span class="sc">Order of Consolidation of the Constituent Minerals in Plutonic Rocks.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class="c014">“There is in plutonic rocks a normal order of consolidation for
the several constituents, which holds good with a high degree of
generality. It is in the main, as pointed out by Rosenbusch, a
law of ‘decreasing basicity.’ The order is briefly as follows:</p>

<p class="c007">“1. Minor accessories (apatite, zircon, sphene, garnet, etc.) and
iron ores.</p>

<p class="c007">“2. Ferro-magnesian minerals—olivine, rhombic pyroxenes,
augite, ægirine, hornblende, biotite, muscovite.</p>

<p class="c007">“3. Felspathic minerals—plagioclase felspars (in order from
anorthite to albite), orthoclase (and anorthoclase).</p>

<p class="c007">“4. Quartz, and finally microcline.</p>

<p class="c007">“In most rocks such minerals as are present follow the above
order. The most important exceptions are the intergrowth of
orthoclase and quartz and the crystallization of quartz in advance
of orthoclase in some acid rocks, and the rather variable relations
between groups 2 and 3 in some more basic rocks. The order laid
down applies in general to parallel intergrowths of allied minerals;
thus when augite is intergrown with ægirine or hornblende the
former mineral forms the kernel of the complex crystal and the
latter the outer shell; when a plagioclase crystal consists of successive
layers of different compositions the layers become progressively
more acid from the center to the margin.</p>

<p class="c007">“Certain constituents having variable relations are omitted from
the foregoing list. Thus nepheline (elæolite) and sodalite belong
to group 3, but may crystallize out either before or after the
feldspar.”<a id="r157"></a><a class="c011 pginternal" href="#f157"><sup>[157]</sup></a></p>

  <h2 class="c005">OPTICAL SCHEME.</h2>
</div>
<h3 class="c013"> <span class="sc">Introduction.</span></h3>

<h3 class="c013">The scheme is designed to furnish the student with a practical method of recognizing the common minerals in rock sections.</h3>

<p class="c014">The arrangement followed has been to group minerals having
general optical characters in common, at the same time giving
their specific characters so as to make it possible to distinguish
one from another. In each rectangle the minerals are arranged in
order of their indices of refraction.</p>

<p class="c007">A tabulation of the minerals, with a list of optical characters
appended, is of aid to the skilled investigator, but of very little
assistance to the beginner.</p>

<p class="c007">The more common minerals, or those which are important petrographically,
are printed in heavy-faced type; the minerals of less
importance in small capitals.</p>

<h3 class="c013"> <span class="sc">Abbreviations and Conventions Used.</span></h3>

<p class="c018">A. = Amorphous.</p>

<p class="c019">I. = Isometric system.</p>

<p class="c019">T. = Tetragonal system.</p>

<p class="c019">O. = Orthorhombic system.</p>

<p class="c019">M. = Monoclinic system.</p>

<p class="c019">Tri. = Triclinic system.</p>

<p class="c019">H. = Hexagonal system.</p>

<p class="c019">M(H). = Monoclinic, with hexagonal form or characters, as in the case of
biotite.</p>

<p class="c019">⟂ = At right angles to.</p>

<p class="c019">El. = Elongation.</p>

<p class="c019">Ex. = Extinction.</p>

<p class="c019">∥ Ex. = Parallel extinction, as when the crystals extinguish parallel to cleavage
lines or crystal edges. Extinction which is symmetrical to intersecting
cleavage lines is also included under this term.</p>

<p class="c019">The mean refractive indices are printed in heavy-faced type.</p>

<p class="c019">The term “grains” is used to describe not only minerals which occur in
typically granular form, but also those which have coarser allotriomorphic form,
as elæolite and sodalite in plutonic rocks, such as syenite, etc.</p>

<div>
  <span class="pageno" id="Page_146">146</span>
  <h3 class="c013"> <span class="sc">General Rules for Use of Scheme.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class="c014">The division of the scheme into two vertical columns is based
on the values of the mean refractive indices, as determined by the
“relief” and appearance of the surface. When the refractive index
is above 1.60, the relief is fairly well to distinctly marked and the
surface rough to very rough, depending on the value of the index.</p>

<p class="c007">Most of the rock-forming minerals with indices below 1.60 show
no relief and a smooth surface, except in the case of a few of the
rarer minerals (mostly isometric), which have very low indices
and hence rough surface.</p>

<p class="c007">Mistakes may easily be made in the case of minerals near the
limit; but practice and the use of the Becke test should soon make
possible the classification into the two groups suggested by the
scheme, and the appended descriptions will help to check errors.</p>

<p class="c007">When an unknown mineral lies adjacent to one that is known,
use the Becke test for obtaining the relative refractive index of the
unknown mineral; focus sharply on the line of contact between
the known and unknown minerals,<a id="r158"></a><a class="c011 pginternal" href="#f158"><sup>[158]</sup></a> then raise the objective slightly
and the “bright line” will appear on the side of the mineral having
the higher index. The method of Schrœder van der Kolk may
also be employed, see p. <a href="#Page_22" class="pginternal">22</a>.</p>

<p class="c007">The horizontal divisions of the scheme depend on the relative
strength of the double refraction based on the observed interference
colors. These colors to be of use in classification must be
correctly recognized. The lower and middle colors of the 1°
order, from bluish-gray through white to yellow, are easily known.
The bright red, blue, green, etc., colors of the 1°, 2° and 3° orders
can also be differentiated without trouble from the very high
order colors (4° and above), which are essentially white in tone
with no decided color tint.</p>

<p class="c007">When confusion arises, the exact order of the color can be
determined by a quartz wedge, as given on p. <a href="#Page_35" class="pginternal">35</a>. Furthermore,
a ¼ undulation mica plate serves to quickly distinguish between
the 1° order white and the practically colorless, high order tint of
calcite, titanite, etc.; as after the insertion of the test-plate the 1°
order white suffers a marked change in color, while the very high
order (practically white) tint shows no appreciable change.</p>

<p class="c007"><span class="pageno" id="Page_147">147</span>In the determination of these interference colors care must be
given to considerations of orientation and thickness. The section
must give the maximum interference color of all the obtainable
sections of the mineral in the rock section. Such sections will be
parallel to the <em>ć</em> axis in the uniaxial minerals and to the axial plane
in the biaxial minerals; and will, therefore, in convergent light
never show the emergence of an optic axis or bisectrix. Crystal
“form,” cleavage, pleochroism, etc., may at times aid in the selection
of these sections. The thickness of the section must also be
considered, and it is well in all cases to pick out some known
mineral in the section, as quartz, and note its maximum interference
color. Knowing how this varies from the color given by the
scheme for a section 0.03 mm.<a id="r159"></a><a class="c011 pginternal" href="#f159"><sup>[159]</sup></a> in thickness, due allowance can
be made for a like variation in the colors given by the other minerals.
In the case of minerals with strong absorption the interference
colors may not be noticeable on account of the absorption
of parts of the light.</p>

<p class="c007">Under the subhead of pleochroism, the vibration direction of the
ray of a definite color is given and not the direction of transmission
of that ray.</p>

<p class="c007">The interference figures in convergent light increase in clearness
and distinctness with the strength of the double refraction.
In uniaxial crystals sections at right angles to the optic axis, <em>i. e.</em>,
sections which remain dark during a revolution between crossed
nicols, show the best interference figures. In biaxial crystals the
most characteristic interference figures are shown by sections at
right angles to the acute bisectrix.</p>

<p class="c007">Crystal sections which are too small do not give very satisfactory
interference figures with convergent light.<a id="r160"></a><a class="c011 pginternal" href="#f160"><sup>[160]</sup></a></p>

<p class="c007">Any scheme, however designed, makes a more or less arbitrary
classification of the minerals, and when in doubt it is always safer
to look for the mineral on both sides of the scheme line.</p>

<p class="c007">The rarer minerals are not included in this scheme, so when the
determination of a mineral is uncertain or not positive recourse
should be had to more elaborate tables.</p>

so it is only when the mineral has a higher or lower index of refraction that its surface
appears rough. When internal structure is to be studied, the crystal should be

nicol and condensing lens are generally left in place below the stage of the microscope,
as polarized light serves as well for these investigations as ordinary light.
An additional advantage in this arrangement is that the condensing lens is always
ready for the “relief” test and the lower nicol for the pleochroism test; but it
must be remembered that the polarizer or lower nicol cuts out one half of the light,
which comes to it from the reflector, and this loss is important when high power
objectives are to be used. When very low power objectives are used, the condensing

<p class="c007">This method is particularly favorable for the accurate determination of the
refractive indices of small isolated fragments or grains, by using liquids of known
indices. In this case a bright line appears on the “near” edge and a dark line
on the “far” edge if the grain has a higher index than the liquid. The reverse
occurs when the index is lower than the liquid. When the index is the same (using
white light) the “far” edge is blue and the “near” edge red and also the contours
about disappear.</p>

to the north and south cross-wire in the eye-piece. This adjustment can be tested
by means of a section of biotite, showing cleavage cracks. When the plane of
vibration of the polarizer is parallel to the N. and S. cross-wire in the eye-piece,
the biotite section becomes almost dark when its cleavage cracks are parallel to
the same cross-wire. The upper nicol, or analyzer, must, of course, be removed

Its habit is isometric. The consensus of opinion seems to be that leucite
crystallizes in the isometric system, but that the isometric molecular arrangement,
at least of the larger crystals, cannot exist for the temperature and pressure at the
earth’s surface. Hence molecular displacement takes place, giving rise to a more
or less complicated apparent twinning, and optical anomalies are noticed. The
isotropic character returns if the section is heated to 500° C. Iddings’ <cite>Rock Minerals</cite>,

<p class="c007"><a href="#r112" class="pginternal">112</a>. In the determination of feldspar microlites it is well to remember the following
facts: “Microcline is rarely, or never, seen in the condition of microlites, while
the associations of labradorite and albite are so different that there is little danger
of confounding them. Labradorite is the commonest product of the consolidation
of the basic eruptives, and albite almost invariably results from metamorphism,
frequently from the contact of igneous rocks on the calcareous clastics.” N. H.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG™
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away—you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

electronic works
</div><div>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg™
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in your

Project Gutenberg™ electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div><div>
1.B. “Project Gutenberg” is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg™
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div><div>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the
Foundation” or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div><div>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg™ License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg™ work (any work
on which the phrase “Project Gutenberg” appears, or with which the
phrase “Project Gutenberg” is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div><blockquote><div>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div></blockquote><div>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg” associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg™
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div><div>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg™ License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.
</div><div>
1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg™
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg™.
</div><div>

active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg™ License.
</div><div>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg™ work in a format
other than “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg™ website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original “Plain
Vanilla ASCII” or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg™ License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div><div>
1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg™ works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div><div>

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
provided that:
</div><ul>
    <li>• You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.”
    </li>
    <li>• You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
        works.
    </li>
    <li>• You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    </li>
    <li>• You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
        distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.
    </li>
</ul><div>
1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.
</div><div>
1.F.
</div><div>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div><div>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div><div>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div><div>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
</div><div>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div><div>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in

production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div><div>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div><div>
The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.
</div><div>

Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div><div>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div><div>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div><div>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div><div>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
</div><div>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div><div>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div><div>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
