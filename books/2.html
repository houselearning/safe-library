<p class="drop-capa0_0_6 c008">
An all-pervading feeling of profound responsibility
to society in general, can be the
only reason for a man, by far the most celebrated
expert in his special field of endeavor,
not to try to maintain a monopoly of his scientific
findings, but make them accessible to the
public. Such altruism is so much more remarkable
if this man happens to be a member
of the Æsculapian priesthood, a clan which,
not unlike the Holy Roman Church, always
assumed, and still assumes to a certain extent,
an air of mysticism, for the purpose of barring
the layman. For the very same reason—that
of maintaining a monopoly—dead and obsolete
languages are resorted to, for recording
experiences in the form of technical terms,
and even for the writing of prescriptions.</p>

<p class="c009">Of course, it must be admitted that the activities
of insufficiently informed people,
known as “quacks,” have done great damage
to society. On the other hand, nobody will
deny any more that the popularizing of modern
<span class="pageno" id="Page_14">14</span>hygiene, bacteriology, anatomy and pathology
has proven a boon to humanity in
general.</p>

<p class="c009">It is typical of the Father of Psychoanalysis,
imbued with a deep sense of fairness towards
mankind, that he has never indulged in
a narrow-minded, professional point of view.</p>

<p class="c009">The mere accident that it remained for the
science of medicine to discover the Psychology
of the Unconscious and Psychoanalysis as
such, was not enough reason for Sigmund
Freud to treat his discovery as a strictly medical
preserve.</p>

<p class="c009">Very helpful to Freud in this respect was
the fact that he has a striking gift to make
himself easily understood to the laity, in a
manner usually not to be found in people specializing
in the intricacies of science. Doubtless,
Sigmund Freud’s astonishing gift to be
his own best popularizer, unquestionably takes
root in his ability to fathom the soul of others,
to speak to each and everyone in their own
language, as it were.</p>

<p class="c009">To my mind, Sigmund Freud’s treatise on
<cite>The Problem of Lay-Analyses</cite> gives much
<span class="pageno" id="Page_15">15</span>more than the title promises. This treatise is
a complete outline, succinct and lucid at the
same time, of psychoanalysis in its present
state. If anybody would ask me today what
book I could recommend to him for the easy
understanding and grasping of the very essence
of Psychoanalysis, I should not hesitate
to recommend <cite>The Problem of Lay-Analyses</cite>.
This book, to my best knowledge and belief,
appears to me exemplary in its lucidity.</p>

<p class="c009">Freud unhesitatingly and strongly criticises
“quacks,” who attempt to employ psychoanalysis
without first being fully prepared for such
work. To him it does not make the slightest
difference whether these “quacks” are medically
trained men—most of whom have up
to now given only scant sympathy to his teachings—or,
medically unprepared laymen.
Freud is of the opinion that it is not the <em>medical</em>
training and the “M.D.” degree which
makes a man a competent psychoanalyst, but
rather inherent insight into the human soul—first
of all, into the unconscious layers of his
own soul—and <em>practical</em> training. According
to Freud, there are just as many medical as
<span class="pageno" id="Page_16">16</span>non-medical “quacks” exploiting psychoanalysis
to the detriment of the general public and
the new science as such. Moreover, at the
present time, the relations of psychoanalysis
to sciences in general are at least as close as
they are to biology and medicine. It would,
therefore, seem unfair to exclude non-medically
trained men and women from the circle
of psychoanalysts.</p>

<p class="c009">Of course, Freud does not close his eyes to
the danger lurking behind the possibility of
confounding strictly organic diseases with so-called
functional or nervous ailments. Only
after it is ascertained beyond doubt, by thorough
medical examination, that a patient is
a subject for psychoanalytical treatment, does
Freud permit him to participate in the benefits
of this therapy.</p>

<p class="c009">The number of physicians is too limited
and their duties in general too manifold to
allow all of them to devote themselves to the
study and the application of psychoanalysis,
to an extent which would actually exhaust the
healing qualities of this new science. A whole
army of psychoanalysts alone would be necessary
<span class="pageno" id="Page_17">17</span>to treat all those so-called incorrigible
children whose ailings and failings constitute
a grave danger for the coming generation.
Great numbers of trained psychoanalysts
would also be necessary to attend to such
“cases” as penal and insane institutions offer,
for the purpose of gradually substituting sanitariums
for penitentiaries.</p>

<p class="c009">“Criminal Therapy,” on a psychoanalytical
basis, looms up to me as one of the biggest
issues facing us, at the present time. Another
issue, less urgent perhaps, is the psychological
readjustment that thousands upon thousands
need in their relations to family, profession
and society in general. This opens a tremendous
field for the analytically trained social
workers.</p>

<p class="c009">Another field where applied psychoanalysis
might become one of the indispensable necessities
is the realm of education. All school
teachers ought to have a thorough psychoanalytical
training, so that we may entrust
our children to them with more confidence.
Finally—last but not least—all professional
men whose work, in one way or another, has
<span class="pageno" id="Page_18">18</span>any bearing on the human soul, should be
psychoanalytically trained. Anthropology,
sociology, history, the psychology of art can
no longer dispense with psychoanalysis.</p>

<p class="c009">It is in view of the extreme importance of
psychoanalysis in all these fields of human
endeavor that Freud asks whether the immeasurable
advantages which the new science
presents should be restricted, from sheer fear
of a more or less studiously over-emphasized
danger resulting from quackery. Dissemination
of information seems to be the best agent
for discouraging quackery and spreading dependable
facts on the subject.</p>

<p class="c009">For the necessity of preparing an American
edition of <cite>The Problem of Lay-Analyses</cite> so
soon after the publication of the German original,
I myself may serve as a witness. It was
my good fortune to accompany Dr. Freud on
his now almost historical Argonauts’ trip to
America in 1909, and admire the courageous
readiness with which America’s outstanding
leaders in the fields of psychology and neurology
interested themselves in Freud’s theories.
At that time, Freud and his teachings
<span class="pageno" id="Page_19">19</span>were still the bone of contention in the camps
of European scientists.</p>

<p class="c009">The Nestor of America’s psychology, Dr.
G. Stanley Hall, enthusiastically embraced
Freud’s teachings. Dr. William James, the
great philosopher and psychologist, listened to
our gospel with great interest, though not as
enthusiastic as Dr. Hall. Touching to the extreme
was that youthful thirst of knowledge,
with which Dr. James J. Putnam, that grand
old man of Harvard University, hung on the
lips of Dr. Freud. It is due to the untiring
efforts of these men and the translation of
Freud’s books by Dr. A. A. Brill, that psychoanalysis,
in a comparatively short time and to
a surprisingly great extent, gained ground in
all strata of society in the United States. It is
a matter of record that America became interested
in Psychoanalysis much quicker than
Europe.</p>

<p class="c009">Now, visiting America again after almost
twenty years, I had occasion to observe how
lasting and far-reaching an influence Dr.
Freud’s teachings exert on all strata of American
society. Of course, not only Freud and
<span class="pageno" id="Page_20">20</span>what he stands for, but also psychology in
general, especially as it is applied to education.
Time and again, I have noticed that it
seems fairly impossible to listen to a conversation
for any length of time, without hearing
problems of psychoanalysis and the name
Freud mentioned.</p>

<p class="c009">Not less stimulating and informative than
the first, is the second part of the present
volume, containing Freud’s own story of his
life and his science. It is common knowledge
today that Freud, in his inimitable objectivity,
has always published facts and fancies
which other scientists would have been only
too careful to hide from the eyes of their contemporaries.</p>

<p class="c009">On the occasion of Freud’s seventieth birthday,
I wrote in <span class="sc">The International Journal
of Psychoanalysis</span> (July/October
1926):</p>

<p class="c010">So far as his personality is concerned, he has
completely taken the wind from the sails of
modern methods of inquiry which attempts to
gain fresh insight into the development of a
scientist’s views, by studying the intimate details
<span class="pageno" id="Page_21">21</span>of his private life. In his “<cite><span lang="de">Traumdeutung</span></cite>”
and “<cite><span lang="de">Psychopathologie des Alltagslebens</span></cite>”,
Freud has undertaken this task himself in a
way previously unknown, and has not only indicated
new lines of research for this kind of
inquiry, but given for all time an example of a
candor quite ruthless towards himself. He has
also revealed unhesitatingly the ‘secrets of the
laboratory’, the inevitable vacillations and uncertainties
that are usually so carefully kept
hidden.</p>

<p class="c011">I hope that the reader will agree with me
that the part of this book which contains
Freud’s “An Autobiographical Study” again
displays candor and frankness to an astonishing
degree. This part of the present volume,
aside from other information, will also demonstrate
to the student of psychology the tolerance
Freud manifests in regard to former disciples
of his who, apparently driven by an
overpowering impatience, or because “they
did not fancy to dwell in the Depths of the
Unconscious” only too early, and with deplorable
rashness, hastened to generalize their
ideas, notwithstanding the insufficiency of
their theories to explain complicated facts. As
<span class="pageno" id="Page_22">22</span>far as I am personally concerned, I cannot
help considering Freud as one of the most progressive
disciples of his own teachings, while
the apostates of his doctrine appear to me as
prematurely aged reactionaries.</p>

<p class="c009">Equipped with devious excuses and devices,
these apostates deserted the paths of Freud’s
teachings—paths that require the courage of
the born pioneer—to return to the broad and
beaten paths of orthodox psychology and
biology.</p>

<p class="c009">May I not once more quote myself in this
connection?</p>

<p class="c009">On December 28, 1926, speaking before the
Mid-winter meeting of the American Psychoanalytical
Association, I said:</p>

<p class="c010">It is a great mistake to gauge the age of a
person by the number of years he has lived. To
remain productive and to be capable of changing
one’s opinions is to stay young. Both of
these attributes are highly characteristic of
Professor Freud, as his latest works attest.
One finds nothing in them of stagnation in dogmatic
assertions or of exhaustion of the fantasy.
Against his own earlier theses he is perhaps
often too unsparing, and the breadth of
<span class="pageno" id="Page_23">23</span>his perspective often exceeds everything which
he has created in the past.</p>

<p class="c011">In conclusion, I wish to express the hope
that this book will assist in dissipating an
erroneous belief prevalent in certain circles.
It appears that the general public have a
decided tendency to confound Freud’s teachings
and psychoanalysis, as such, with the
subject of sex. “According to Freud there is
only one <em>causa movens</em>, and that is sex!” is
one of their mis-statements.</p>

<p class="c009">Of course, faithful students of Freud’s
teachings will never arrive at such fallacious
deductions. True, the attentive reader of this
book will find that Freud, as far as sex is concerned,
allots to this instinct more importance
than the prudery and hypocrisy of present-day
society is ready to grant it. But, ever and
again, Freud emphasizes the mastering of
urges—not by repression, to be sure, but by
elimination of all that which appears logically,
ethically, and æsthetically undesirable.</p>

  <h2 class="c005">THE PROBLEM OF LAY-ANALYSES</h2>
</div>
<div>
  <span class="pageno" id="Page_27">27</span>
  <h3 class="c001">I</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-capa0_0_6 c008">It appears to me that the title of this treatise
may require an explanation. Let me,
therefore, state that the problem of Lay-Analyses
expresses itself most succinctly in
the question of whether medically untrained
laymen should be permitted to practise psychoanalysis.</p>

<p class="c009">This problem, timely in general, is subject
to national laws.</p>

<p class="c009">It is a timely question, in so far as, up to
now, apparently nobody ever cared who was
practising psychoanalysis. As a matter of fact,
too little attention was paid to the question into
whose hands the employment of this new
science was entrusted, with unanimity prevailing
only in reference to a more or less strong
tendency to wish that nobody at all should
<span class="pageno" id="Page_28">28</span>practise psychoanalysis. There were different
reasons for this well-nigh general aversion.</p>

<p class="c009">The demand, then, now put before the
legislatures of certain countries, that only
physicians be permitted to apply psychoanalysis
proves that, after all, a new, and apparently
more tolerant opinion is becoming
prevalent, as regards the recognition of our
science. This new trend of putting the stamp
of official and scientific approval on psychoanalysis,
by reserving the monopoly of its
application to medically trained men, must,
however, first successfully clear itself of any
and all suspicion of being nothing other than
just a modification of the resistance hitherto
shown towards psychoanalysis. Today, at last,
it is admitted that, under certain circumstances,
psychoanalytical treatment is in order.
However, if it is to be applied, certain
countries stand ready to impose the restriction
that licensed physicians only shall be permitted
to administer this treatment.</p>

<p class="c009">The problem before us right now, then, is
why only physicians should be permitted to
practise psychoanalysis. This is a problem
<span class="pageno" id="Page_29">29</span>subject to national laws. In the United States
and Germany, for example, this problem
does not amount to more than just an academic
discussion, because in these countries a patient
may receive treatment from anybody he
chooses. In these countries, anybody who feels
the inclination may treat, as a “quack” to be
sure, “cases,” provided he stands ready to assume
full responsibility for the effect of his
treatment. Not before the authorities are actually
appealed to to retaliate for such tangible
harm as a patient may have suffered from
the hands of an unlicensed practitioner of
psychoanalysis, does the law interfere in the
United States, Germany and many other
countries.</p>

<p class="c009">In Austria, however, where I am writing
this treatise, bearing in mind the special conditions
which prevail there, in regard to the
administration of psychoanalytical treatment,
the authorities employ the law of the country
as a preventive. In my country, without considering
ultimate results, the law, in sweeping
restrictions, enjoins all and sundry laymen
from treating ailing people.</p>

<p class="c009"><span class="pageno" id="Page_30">30</span>In the Republic of Austria, therefore,
there is a very practical aspect to the question
of whether laymen should be permitted to
treat ailing people with psychoanalysis. As
a matter of fact, under present conditions,
this question seems to be settled since it is
already answered by the wording of the law,
now appearing on the statutes of my country:
Nervous people are unquestionably sick people;
laymen are doubtlessly no licensed physicians;
psychoanalysis is a remedy for the
healing, or improvement, of nervous disorders.
As in the eyes of the law, the latter
are considered diseases and the treatment of
all such ailments reserved for licensed physicians
exclusively, laymen are liable to severe
punishment when employing psychoanalysis
for the treatment of nervous people.</p>

<p class="c009">In view of this plain state of affairs, one
scarcely dares to approach the question of permitting
the laity to practise psychoanalysis
in Austria. However, in spite of the obviousness
of the situation as a whole, there are some
additional aspects to the question which,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_31">31</span>albeit the law does not take cognisance of
them, should nevertheless be considered.</p>

<p class="c009">It may develop that in connection with
psychoanalysis, people in need of treatment
are not sick people, in the broad meaning of
this term; laymen not always to be considered
laymen, nor physicians what physicians are
generally supposed to be—the very premise
upon which these physicians base their claims.
If such a state of affairs becomes apparent, it
would be justifiable to insist upon a modification
of the law, prohibiting the unlicensed
practise of medicine, as far as the application
of psychoanalytic treatment is concerned.</p>

<div>
  <span class="pageno" id="Page_32">32</span>
  <h3 class="c001">II</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-capa0_0_6 c008">Whether this modification shall be
enacted as a law will depend mostly
on people who may not be expected to know
the peculiarities of analytical treatment. It
will be our task, therefore, to instruct these
impartial referees, these typical laymen whom
we will assume, for the time being, are completely
uninformed. It is regrettable that we
cannot arrange for them to attend an analytical
treatment in the rôle of an observer. It is
one of the peculiarities of the “analytical
situation” that it will not suffer the presence
of a third party.</p>

<p class="c009">Moreover, individual sessions are liable to
be very unequal, as regards the information
they may yield. Mr. Referee happening in
at an analytical session, would probably not
profit to any great extent. As a matter of fact,
he might altogether misinterpret that which
is discussed between the analyst and the patient.
<span class="pageno" id="Page_33">33</span>He may even become downright bored
with the proceedings. Therefore Mr. Referee
must needs be satisfied with the information
we shall presently impart to him, endeavoring
to set it forth as lucidly as possible.</p>

<p class="c009">Let us assume that the patient is suffering
from attacks of moodiness, which he is unable
to control, or else is the victim of a despondency
so depressing as to paralyse his energy,
causing him to lose all confidence in himself,
manifesting extreme self-consciousness when
among strangers. Without grasping the underlying
elements of his case, the patient may observe
that not only the discharge of his daily
duties becomes more and more arduous for
him, but also that he experiences difficulties
when called upon to make a decision or embark
upon some enterprise.</p>

<p class="c009">One day—utterly ignorant of the exact cause—he
succumbs to an attack of fear. From
then on, he is unable to cross a street alone,
or board a train, without fighting off a certain
inarticulate fear. This condition, as a matter
of fact, may even become so pronounced as to
render it absolutely impossible for him to
<span class="pageno" id="Page_34">34</span>cross a street, or board a train, unaccompanied.</p>

<p class="c009">Or—what appears very peculiar to him—his
thoughts “wander”; they are no longer
subject to his will. They attach themselves to
problems which, in reality, do not interest him
at all but which he is, nevertheless, unable to
dismiss from his mind. He imposes perfectly
ludicrous tasks upon himself, such as counting
the windows along the street. When attending
to simple functions, such as mailing a letter or
turning off the gas, doubts harass him a few
moments later, as to whether he has really
dropped the letter into the mail box and
whether he actually turned off the gas.</p>

<p class="c009">Perhaps such a condition is merely annoying
at first, but it becomes intolerable when,
in advanced stages, it proves impossible to
shake off such preposterous ideas as having
flung a child under the wheels of a car, or
thrown somebody from a bridge into the river,
or being haunted by the terrifying doubt of
whether he is not in reality the murderer the
police are trying to apprehend for the latest
spectacular crime.</p>

<p class="c009"><span class="pageno" id="Page_35">35</span>All these delusions are utter nonsense, as
he himself very well knows. He has never
done any harm to anybody, but if he really
were a fugitive from justice, this obsession,
this feeling of contrition could not be
stronger.</p>

<p class="c009">To take another case:—this time of a female
patient, who is suffering in an entirely
different way, presenting entirely different
symptoms. We will assume that she is a pianiste,
who suddenly experiences cramps in her
fingers and discovers herself unable to play.
As soon as she thinks of attending a social
affair, she immediately feels the necessity of
obeying a recurrent natural need, making it
impossible for her to leave her own house.
Thus, she has been forced to give up mingling
with her friends, or attend dances, the theatre,
or concerts.</p>

<p class="c009">At the most inopportune moments, she becomes
the victim of headaches or other painful
sensations. Eventually, after meals, she
feels impelled to yield to nausea, a condition
which, if prolonged, may become dangerous.
Finally, she becomes absolutely unable to
<span class="pageno" id="Page_36">36</span>stand any of those little excitements which
cannot be eliminated from daily life. Upon
such occasions, she readily faints. As these
spells are frequently complicated with muscular
spasms, such attacks assume the aspect
of dreadful afflictions.</p>

<p class="c009">Still other patients become subject to disturbances
in a sphere where bodily functions
coördinate with manifestations of sentiment.
If men, they find themselves unable to give
physiological expression to those tender urges
that induce them to gravitate towards the
other sex. On the other hand, all these physiological
reactions may be at their command
when not aimed at the person they cherish
most. Then, there are still other cases, when
bonds of sensuality will tie them to persons
whom they actually despise and of whom
they have the most earnest desire to free themselves.
Or their sensuality imposes urges upon
them whose fulfillment causes them to
shudder.</p>

<p class="c009">If they be women, such patients, on account
of fear or disgust, or from some other restraint
of unknown origin, become unable to perform
<span class="pageno" id="Page_37">37</span>those functions which their sex imposes upon
them. In cases where they have yielded to the
prompting of passion, they discover that that
gratification is withheld from them which nature
normally offers as a reward for such complacency.</p>

<p class="c009">Sooner or later, all such persons come to
consider themselves as sick and appeal to physicians,
expecting to be cured of their nervous
ailments. Physicians have classified these manifestations,
diagnosing them differently, according
to their own personal point of view.
These ailments are listed under such terms
as neurasthenia, psychasthenia, phobias and
neuroses of different kinds, and with that
sweeping term hysterics. The parts of the
body inducing such disturbances are examined:
the heart, the stomach, the intestines, the
sex organs, and all are found to be in the
best of condition. The physician then advises
the patient to change his mode of living, to
take a vacation, to exercise. Thus, with perhaps
the aid of mild stimulants, the patient’s
condition may, or may not, be temporarily
relieved.</p>

<p class="c009"><span class="pageno" id="Page_38">38</span>Eventually, the patient is informed that
there are certain practitioners who specialize
in the treatment of just such ailments, and
thus they come to be psychoanalysed.</p>

<p class="c009">Mr. Referee, whom we will assume is present,
has impatiently listened, while we have
given an account of the nervous disturbances
with which one may be afflicted. Mr. Referee
suddenly becomes attentive, expressing his
growing interest in these words: “Well, now
at last we shall see what the psychoanalyst will
do with the patient, whom physicians could
not help.”</p>

<p class="c009">To all appearances, nothing takes place between
patient and psychoanalyst except that
they talk with each other. The psychoanalyst
does not take recourse to any instruments,
while examining the patient, nor does he write
out prescriptions. If it can be arranged, he
will not even take the patient out of his usual
surroundings, or upset his daily routine in
any way, while treating him. Such a procedure
is, of course, not of indispensable necessity,
quite frequently proving impossible to arrange.
Usually the analyst simply makes an
<span class="pageno" id="Page_39">39</span>appointment with his patient, then lets him
talk, listens to him, lets him talk again and
listens once more.</p>

<p class="c009">Mr. Referee now clearly manifests relief
but, at the same time, his face also assumes a
disdainful expression. Apparently, he thinks:
“Is that all? ‘Words, words, words,’ as Prince
Hamlet says. Is psychoanalysis perhaps some
sort of magic rite, employing mere words with
which to chase away a patient’s ailment?”</p>

<p class="c009">Quite right! It surely would be magic if
it would only work faster. One of the indispensable
essentialities of magic is quickness,
sudden results. But psychoanalytical treatment
demands months, sometimes even years. Proceeding
at such a snail’s pace, it loses the character
of anything resembling magic.</p>

<p class="c009">As far as “words, words, words” are concerned,
they are surely not to be looked down
upon. Words, after all, are a powerful instrument,
the means by which we express our
feelings to each other, the agent through which
we influence one another. Words are able to
benefit us in the extreme, or liable to hurt us
to the quick. Doubtless, “in the beginning was
<span class="pageno" id="Page_40">40</span>the Deed” and the Word came only later. Under
certain circumstances, the reduction of
the Deed to the mere Word may even prove a
cultural achievement. At any rate, the Word
was originally an implement of sorcery, a
magic manifestation which even today still retains
much of its old potency.</p>

<p class="c009">Mr. Referee now remarks: “Assuming
that the patient is not any better prepared for
the understanding of psychoanalytical treatment,
than I myself, how are you going to
induce him to believe in the Magic of the
Word, that is to deliver him from his sufferings?”</p>

<p class="c009">Of course, some preparatory work is necessary,
but that is easily accomplished in a
simple manner. The patient is asked to be
absolutely frank with the psychoanalyst, not
to withhold intentionally anything that crowds
itself into his mind, and to overcome gradually
all such influences as may exert themselves
to prevent certain of his thoughts or memories
from being communicated to the psychoanalyst.</p>

<p class="c009">There is not one of us but does not know
<span class="pageno" id="Page_41">41</span>that there are certain things which we hate to
tell anybody else, or which we are utterly
unable to express at all. These are the so-called
“most intimate” things. We also surmise—and
this proves the great progress that has
been made in the psychological understanding
of our Selves—that there are some other things
which we hate to admit to ourselves, which we
try to hide from ourselves and which, once
they are accidentally touched upon, we immediately
endeavor to crowd out of our
thoughts.</p>

<p class="c009">Doubtless, the root of a very remarkable
psychological problem manifests itself in the
fact that there are certain of our thoughts
which we try to hide from our very own Self!
That would seem to indicate that our very own
Self is not an indivisible unit, as we have always
considered it! Rather, that there is a
certain something which may rise in opposition
to our very own Self! Vaguely, then, we
surmise that our own Self and our soul life
may be two different things! If, now, the patient
submits to the demand of psychoanalysis
to express everything in words that comes
<span class="pageno" id="Page_42">42</span>to his mind, he comes to believe that an interchange
of thoughts, under such extraordinary
conditions, is liable to lead to extraordinary
results.</p>

<p class="c009">“I understand you very well,” Mr. Referee
says. “You simply assume that everybody suffering
from a nervous disturbance is harboring
something that depresses him, some dark
secret, perhaps, and by inducing him to impart
this secret to you, you relieve him of that depression,
thus alleviating his suffering. That,
after all, is the very principle of the Confessional
which the Catholic church has employed
for centuries to wield her influence
over her communicants.”</p>

<p class="c009">Yes and no, is our answer to this. The Confessional,
to a certain extent, may be considered
as belonging into the realm of psychoanalysis;
leading up to it, as it were. However,
the Confessional as such is far removed from
coinciding with the very being of psychoanalysis,
and it is unable to explain the results of
psychoanalytical treatment. In the Confessional,
the sinner tells what he knows, but in
the Analysis, the neurotic is expected to reveal
<span class="pageno" id="Page_43">43</span>much more. Besides, there are no known cases
where the Confessional proved effective
enough to remedy direct symptoms of ailments.</p>

<p class="c009">“Then I don’t understand you after all,”
Mr. Referee interjects. “What do you mean
by stating that the neurotic is ‘expected to reveal
more’ in the course of psychoanalytical
treatment? Of course, I can very well imagine
that you, as a psychoanalyst, may wield a
greater influence over your patient than the
Father Confessor over a penitent, for the simple
reason that you become better acquainted
with him, employing your growing influence
to talk unhealthy thoughts out of your patient,
as it were, disseminating his apprehensions,
and so forth. Frankly, it appears most remarkable
to me that by such a procedure, it should
be possible to alleviate purely physical manifestations,
such as nausea, diarrhœa, and
cramps. I know that such results are possible
by taking recourse to hypnosis. Most probably,
through prolonged association with your patient,
you gradually succeed in establishing
hypnotic relations between you and him. By
<span class="pageno" id="Page_44">44</span>this I mean that you inadvertently come to exert
upon him a suggestive influence. Thus, the
miracle wrought by your therapy is nothing
other than the result of hypnotic suggestion.
However, as far as I know, results by hypnotic
therapy are procured much quicker than by
psychoanalysis which you yourself admit takes
months, and sometimes even years.”</p>

<p class="c009">After all, Mr. Referee does not seem to be
so utterly uninformed and helplessly at sea as
we had considered him in the beginning.
Doubtless, he is eagerly bent upon grasping
the essence of psychoanalysis, on the basis of
certain knowledge which he has acquired. He
endeavors to connect psychoanalysis with
something he already knows.</p>

<p class="c009">Thus, he forces upon us the difficult task of
explaining to him that he will never succeed
in comprehending psychoanalysis in this way,
because psychoanalysis is a process <em>sui generis</em>,
something new and peculiar, understandable
only with the assistance of new conceptions,
or presumptions.</p>

<p class="c009">However, we still owe our inquisitive friend
a reply to a point raised by him.</p>

<p class="c009"><span class="pageno" id="Page_45">45</span>What you, Mr. Referee, mentioned before
about the personal influence exerted by the
psychoanalyst on his patient, should not go
without comment. Such an influence actually
prevails in the analysis, playing an important
rôle. However, this influence is utterly unlike
the influence induced by hypnosis.</p>

<p class="c009">I shall have to prove to you that the situations
in these two cases decidedly differ from
each other. However, for the time being, the
statement may suffice that this personal influence—this
“suggestive element” if you wish—is
not drawn upon for the purpose of suppressing
symptoms of nervous afflictions analogous
to treatment by hypnotic suggestions.
Besides, it is absolutely wrong to assume that
this “suggestive element” is the agent and
promoter of analytical treatment. It may be
that such is the case right at the beginning of
the treatment. Later, however, this very same
“suggestive element” proves itself an opposing
factor, forcing us to resort to extensive
counter-measures.</p>

<p class="c009">Just let me explain to you how thoroughly
opposed the technique of analysis is to anything
<span class="pageno" id="Page_46">46</span>and everything resembling the hypnotic
technique of diverting or dissipating a patient’s
apprehensions.</p>

<p class="c009">Assumed that our patient is obsessed with
an intense feeling of being guilty of, say, some
horrible crime, we do not advise him to stifle
the qualms of his conscience simply on the
strength of the fact that there is no doubt as
to his innocence. He himself has already proceeded
along this trend of reasoning, but to
no avail. On the contrary, we try to impress
him with the possibility that there may be
something tangible at the bottom of so profound
a feeling of guilt, and that it may be
possible to detect this disturbing something.</p>

<p class="c009">“I should be greatly astonished,” Mr. Referee
interrupts, “if you could really assuage
your patient’s feeling of guilt by agreeing
that there may be some tangible reason for
his apprehension. But what is the mode of
procedure which is applied in your analysis,
and to what treatment do you subject your
patient?”</p>

<div>
  <span class="pageno" id="Page_47">47</span>
  <h3 class="c001">III</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-capa0_0_6 c008">To make myself perfectly plain to you, it
will be necessary for me to acquaint you
with certain psychological teachings which
are not known beyond the circle of analysts
and accordingly, not appreciated beyond this
group. On the basis of this theory, it will be
easy for you to deduce what we expect of the
patient and how we go about obtaining it.</p>

<p class="c009">In explaining matters to you, I will allude
to our theory dogmatically, as if it already
were an accepted doctrine. Nevertheless, I
do not want you to assume that our theory,
as I shall presently put it before you, came into
being as a fully developed, well-rounded out
philosophical system. The development of
our theory came about only very gradually,
little by little, and was built up through continuous
contact with observations. Moreover,
our theory, in accordance with these observations,
was continually modified until it
<span class="pageno" id="Page_48">48</span>finally evolved in a manner apparently satisfactory
for our purposes.</p>

<p class="c009">Only so short a time as a few years back, it
would have been necessary for me to express
this theory in somewhat different terms. And
even today, I cannot guarantee that the terms
I am using are definitely fixed and will not be
modified again. You know very well that
scientific truths do not burst upon us with the
unexpectedness of a sudden phenomenon. As
a rule, any science, long after its early stages,
lacks the character of definiteness, unchangeability,
and infallibility for which our human
way of thinking longs so intensely. However,
any science, as it presents itself to contemporaries,
is science as its best, so far as contemporaries
are able to judge.</p>

<p class="c009">My introductory remarks, I hope, will assist
you in gaining a correct perspective in
reference to psychoanalysis, especially when
I ask you to bear in mind that our specific
science is still very young—hardly as old as
our century, as a matter of fact—and deals
with about the most difficult matter presenting
itself to human research. Let me therefore
<span class="pageno" id="Page_49">49</span>encourage you to interrupt me unabashedly
in my explanations, when you do not grasp
the full meaning of my words and require
further elucidation.</p>

<p class="c009">“I am already interrupting you, even before
you really start. You say that you are going
to acquaint me with a new psychology. But I
was always under the impression that psychology
as such is no new science. As a matter
of fact, it seems to me there always has been
enough psychology and enough psychologists.
In college, I learned of the great things
achieved in this realm of human endeavor.”</p>

<p class="c009">Far be it from me to deny these achievements.
However, scrutinizing them closely,
you will find that they rather belong in the
category of sensory psychology. A doctrine of
soul life never had a chance for development,
because its conception was obstructed by one
very essential misunderstanding. After all,
what does psychology embrace today, as it is
taught in colleges? Aside from a few important
sensorimotoric perceptions, there are
just a number of classifications and definitions
referring to certain processes of the soul
<span class="pageno" id="Page_50">50</span>which, thanks to the fact that these terms have
become a part of our living language, are now
the common property of all educated people.
To all appearances, such limited information
does not enable us to clearly grasp our soul
life.</p>

<p class="c009">Did you ever notice that every philosopher,
poet, historian and biographer evolves his
own psychology, based on individual presumptions,
in regard to the connection and
the ultimate purpose of psychological phenomena,
all of which are more or less acceptable
but altogether and equally unreliable?
Seemingly, a common foundation is
missing. Thus it happens that in the realm
of psychology, there is an utter lack of respect
and authority. There, obviously, anybody is
permitted to “poach” or “freelance” to his
heart’s content.</p>

<p class="c009">If you touch upon a question of physiology
or chemistry, nobody will dare speak up, unless
he is in possession of authentic information.
However, when discussing psychological
questions, you may expect everybody to venture
an opinion, or raise his voice in protest.
<span class="pageno" id="Page_51">51</span>Evidently, there is no “professional knowledge”
in his realm! Inasmuch as everybody
has a soul life, everybody considers himself a
born psychologist.</p>

<p class="c009">There is a story of an old woman who offered
her services to take care of babies. When
asked whether she knew anything about
babies, her answer was: Why, sure, haven’t I
been a baby myself once?</p>

<p class="c009">“And this common foundation of soul life,
overlooked by all psychologists, you claim to
have discovered through the observation of
ailing people?”</p>

<p class="c009">I do not believe that the origin of our findings
minimizes their value. Embryology, for
example, would not enjoy any confidence as a
science if it were unable to explain clearly
the origin of pre-natal deformities.</p>

<p class="c009">You will remember that I have mentioned
before persons whose thoughts insist upon
travelling their own way. To such an extent
as a matter of fact, that such persons are
forced to ponder about problems which do not
interest them at all.</p>

<p class="c009">Do you believe that psychology, as generally
<span class="pageno" id="Page_52">52</span>taught, will be in a position to render
even so much as the slightest assistance for the
explanation of such anomalies? And after all,
there is not one of us whose thoughts, during
the night, do not travel their very own way,
creating visions which we are unable to interpret,
which we are at a loss to understand, and
which frequently appear to be, to an almost
disquieting extent, products of morbidity.</p>

<p class="c009">I am now referring to our dream life!
Among the majority of people, the opinion
always prevailed, and still prevails, that there
is an inherent meaning to dreams, that some
attention ought to be paid to our nocturnal
visions, that a certain interpretative value is attached
to them. Orthodox psychologists have
never been able to interpret the meaning of
dreams. To them, dreams were something
with which they did not know what to do. And
as soon as orthodox psychology tried to interpret
our dream life, their explanations ventured
far afield from psychology proper.
Dreams, according to them, were nothing
other than the result of physiological sensations,
originating from an unequal soundness
<span class="pageno" id="Page_53">53</span>of sleep in different parts of the brain. I venture
to state right here, that any psychology
unable to explain the essence of our dreams
is also inapplicable to the understanding of
normal soul life and cannot be expected to be
recognized as science.</p>

<p class="c009">“You are becoming so aggressive that I surmise
one of your sensitive spots has been
touched upon. I have heard before that in
psychoanalysis great value is attached to
dreams, that dreams are interpreted and behind
them old memories of actual events are
sought. On the other hand, I also know that
the interpretation of dreams is left to the arbitrary
conception of the analyst and that the
analysts between themselves have frequent
squabbles, in regard to the question of how to
interpret a certain dream and the justification
of arriving at certain conclusions. If this is
really the case, I do not think you should stress
the advantage of psychoanalysis, in regard to
orthodox psychology.”</p>

<p class="c009">There you have said something very appropriate.
It is only too true that the interpretation
of dreams in theory, as well as practice of
<span class="pageno" id="Page_54">54</span>psychoanalysis, has achieved incomparable
importance.</p>

<p class="c009">If at this point, I appear to be aggressive to
you, this must be looked upon as a defense
mechanism. When I reflect upon all the nuisance
brought about by some of our analysts
in connection with the interpretation of
dreams, I could despair. I feel like quoting
the pessimistic truism of our great satirist
Nestroy, who once said: “Any progress is only
half as great as it seems to be in the beginning!”
But haven’t you noticed that we mortals
are always bent upon confounding everything
and distorting it? Nevertheless, with a little
caution and self-training, most of the dangers
lurking behind the interpretation of dreams
can be avoided.</p>

<p class="c009">But it will never be possible for me to get
down to the explanation of our new science
which I promised you, if we continually digress.</p>

<p class="c009">“If I understood you correctly, you were
going to speak about the fundamental presumptions
underlying the new psychology.”</p>

<p class="c009">It was not my intention to start with that.
<span class="pageno" id="Page_55">55</span>Rather, I intend to tell you what we have
learned of the soul apparatus, in the course
of our analytical studies.</p>

<p class="c009">“What do you mean by ‘soul apparatus’ and
what is it made of, may I ask?”</p>

<p class="c009">You will soon enough see what the soul apparatus
is. It is irrelevant to ask of what material
it is made, as this question has no psychological
interest. As far as psychology is
concerned, the question of material is just as
unimportant as the question would be in the
realm of optic, of whether a telescope is made
of metal or cardboard. The question of matter
does not enter here at all, but there is great
importance attached to the aspect of space.</p>

<p class="c009">This obscure soul apparatus, which serves
as the agent for all processes of our soul, is
conceived by us as an instrument consisting of
several parts. Each of these parts we shall call
a stage. There is an individual function attached
to each of these stages, and all of them
are correlated to each other in reference to
space. Aspects of space like “near” and “far,”
and “above” and “below,” for the time being,
only serve to illustrate the regular sequence of
<span class="pageno" id="Page_56">56</span>the functions allotted to the different stages of
the soul apparatus.—Do you still follow me?</p>

<p class="c009">“Hardly! However, I hope I will understand
you eventually. At any rate, your explanation
appeals to me as a somewhat peculiar
description of the anatomy of the soul,
which, according to biologists, is nonexistent.”</p>

<p class="c009">I will grant that what you call my “somewhat
peculiar description of the anatomy of
the soul,” is merely a parallel drawn upon for
the purpose of elucidation, as is so often done
in sciences. In the early stages of a new science
such parallels have always been quite primitive,—open
to revision, as it were. I consider
it superfluous to strengthen my argument by
referring to the frequently applied “if,” as is
quite popular in such cases. The actual value
of such “if” argumentations—“fiction” the
philosopher Vaihinger would call it—greatly
depends on how advantageously this argumentation
may be applied to the case in question.</p>

<p class="c009">However, for argument’s sake, let us accept
the popular conception and assume that within
<span class="pageno" id="Page_57">57</span>us there is a psychical organization, recording
sensations and perceptions of physical wants
on one hand, and releasing motoric actions on
the other. This medium for establishing this
definite coöperation we call the “I.”</p>

<p class="c009">Of course, this is nothing new. Each one of
us takes this for granted, if he is not a philosopher,
and some despite being philosophers.
However, our description of the psychical apparatus
is not by far complete.</p>

<p class="c009">Aside from the “I,” we perceive another region
of the soul, much more extensive, much
more impressive, and much more obscure than
the “I,” which we designate the “It.”</p>

<p class="c009">It is the relation between the “I” and the
“It” upon which we shall dwell first.</p>

<p class="c009">Doubtless, you will raise an objection
against our intention to refer to these two regions
or stages of the soul with simple pronouns,
instead of giving them beautiful euphonious
Greek names. However, in psychoanalysis,
we prefer to remain in contact with
the popular way of thinking, and attach commonplace
terms to our scientific conceptions,
rather than look upon such nomenclature in
<span class="pageno" id="Page_58">58</span>contempt. We do not expect to receive credit
for this popularization of psychoanalytical
terms, inasmuch as we are forced to do this in
order to make ourselves plain to our patients
who are frequently very intelligent, but not
always exactly learned people.</p>

<p class="c009">The impersonal pronoun “It” is most appropriate
for our purposes, as is plainly proved
by the fact that we frequently speak of something,
averring that “‘It’ came to me quite
suddenly”; “‘It’ gave me a shock”; “‘It’ was
stronger than I.” “<i><span lang="fr">C’était plus fort que moi.</span></i>”</p>

<p class="c009">In the realm of psychology, we can only
make ourselves understood by taking recourse
to comparisons. This, after all, is no special
peculiarity of psychology, inasmuch as other
sciences also find it necessary to avail themselves
of analogous expedients. These comparisons,
however, must be modified time and
again, as their application generally proves
too limited. If you are seeking an explanation
of the relation of the “I” to the “It,” it would
be well to remember that the “I” serves as a
foreground to the “It.” The “I” is, as it were,
the outer, front layer of the “It.” We may so
<span class="pageno" id="Page_59">59</span>much more readily accept this comparison, inasmuch
as layers—say, of a tree—owe their
peculiar characteristics to the modifying influence
of that exterior medium with which
they are in contact. Thus, we visualize that
the “I,” being the outer layer of the psychical
apparatus, is the “It,” modified in accordance
with the influence which the outer world exerts
upon it.</p>

<p class="c009">Here you will perceive how conceptions of
space apply to psychoanalysis. To all intents
and purposes, the “I” is actually the front
layer, the obvious, whereas the “It” is the inner
layer, the hidden. To make it even more
plain: The “I” is inserted between the reality
of the outer world and the “It,” the latter constituting
the soul proper, the essence of the
soul, as it were.</p>

<p class="c009">“I am not going to inquire how you came
to know all this. I should first like to know
how this differentiation between the ‘I’ and
the ‘It’ assists you in your psychoanalytical
work, and why you need it.”</p>

<p class="c009">Your question clearly shows me how to
proceed.</p>

<p class="c009"><span class="pageno" id="Page_60">60</span>It is most important and extremely valuable
to know that the “I” and the “It,” in many
instances, greatly differ from each other. As
far as the “I” is concerned, psychical activations
are subject to a different rule than the
one applying to the “It.” The “I” has different
intentions from the “It,” availing itself of
means other than those resorted to by the “It.”</p>

<p class="c009">Of course, much could be said in this respect,
but perhaps it will be best if I give you
a new comparison and a new example. Just
remember the differences which developed,
during the late war, between the actual front
and the hinterland. We were apparently never
surprised to observe that there were certain
things going on at the front, utterly different
from analogous developments in the hinterland,
and that in the hinterland many a thing
was permissible which had to be strictly prohibited
at the front. In the war, the deciding
factor, of course, was the proximity of the enemy.
In our psychical life, the deciding factor
is the proximity of the outer world. Remember
that in ancient times “outside,” “strange,”
“hostile,” used to be identical conceptions.</p>

<p class="c009"><span class="pageno" id="Page_61">61</span>And now, the example I promised you: The
“It” is never assailed by any conflicts. Within
the “It,” contradiction and opposition dwell
undisturbed in close proximity to each other,
frequently equalizing one another by means of
compromise. However, while the “It” thus remains
undisturbed, the “I” cannot avoid facing
conflicts, and the only way for the “I”
to escape the dilemma is by renouncing some
particular intention, or urge, for the benefit
of the other.</p>

<p class="c009">The “I” is controlled by a very remarkable
trend for unification, for synthesis—a characteristic
utterly lacking in the “It.” The latter
never manifests such unity of intention, but
rather displays a tendency towards dissipation
and a diversity of aims, utterly independent
of one another, and without regard to each
other.</p>

<p class="c009">“If there really is such an important hinterland
of the soul, how do you explain the fact
that it was never discovered before the advent
of psychoanalysis?”</p>

<p class="c009">By this question, you are leading us back to
one of your former inquiries. Let me advise
<span class="pageno" id="Page_62">62</span>you, then, that orthodox psychology blocked
its own way to the “It,” by holding on tenaciously
to a presumption which, in itself,
seemed obviously enough but which, nevertheless,
cannot be successfully sustained any more.
It was presumed that all psychical activations
are conscious, that consciousness is the
characteristic of any psychological process,
and that if there really were unconscious
processes of our brain, these processes did not
deserve to be termed psychological processes,
having nothing at all to do with psychology
proper.</p>

<p class="c009">“I should say that this is self-evident!”</p>

<p class="c009">Of course. That is exactly what all the orthodox
psychologists claim. However, it is
easy enough to prove that such a view is incorrect,
or rather amounts to an impractical
separation. Observing ourselves, we easily perceive
that many of our thoughts could not have
arisen unless they were induced by certain
premises. However, of the preparatory stages
of these thoughts, which must have been psychical,
too, we are unaware, inasmuch as only
<span class="pageno" id="Page_63">63</span>the complete result enters into our consciousness.
Once in a while, it may be possible for
us to reconstruct the development of a thought
by retrospective contemplation.</p>

<p class="c009">“Most probably, our attention had been diverted
so that we missed observing the development
of the thought in the making, so to
speak.”</p>

<p class="c009">That’s just an obvious excuse!—insufficient
to obscure the fact that quite frequently psychical
activations—and often highly complicated
ones, too—may occur in our soul life
without our becoming actually aware of them.
Alas, you may be ready to accept the hypothesis
that just a little more or less of your
“attention” may prove sufficient to transmute
a non-psychical action into a psychical one.
But why squabble? The existence of unconscious
thoughts has been proven in hypnotic
experiments, time and again, to the satisfaction
of everybody.</p>

<p class="c009">“I don’t wish to deny that, and I actually
believe I am now beginning to understand you
at last. What you are terming the ‘I’ is the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_64">64</span>Conscious while the ‘It’ describes the so-called
Subconscious, which is so much discussed just
now. But why, pray, this masquerade of new
terms, if I may ask?”</p>

<p class="c009">This is no masquerade, inasmuch as other
terms cannot be employed here properly. Besides,
let me ask you not to substitute literature
for science. If somebody refers to the
Subconscious, I don’t know whether he is
alluding to it as a stratum, that is, something
dwelling in the soul beneath the Conscious, or
whether he refers to it as to quality, that is,
another consciousness, a subterranean one, so
to say. To be sure, the greatest probability
seems to be that anybody juggling such terms
is himself not at all sure of what he really
means. The only permissible differentiation is
one between Conscious and Unconscious.</p>

<p class="c009">Nevertheless, it would be a severe error to
believe that a differentiation between Conscious
and Unconscious would be analogous
to a differentiation between the “I” and the
“It.” It would be too wonderful, if it were
as simple as all that, and it would be easy
going for our theory then. But, it is not so
<span class="pageno" id="Page_65">65</span>simple! Correct only is that everything that
occurs within the “It” is and remains unconscious,
and that only activities of the “I” may
become conscious. However, not <em>all</em> these activities
are conscious, nor are they <em>always</em>
conscious, nor do they necessarily <em>have</em> to become
conscious. Parts of the “I” may remain
permanently unconscious.</p>

<p class="c009">The penetration into Consciousness of a
psychical process is quite complicated. I cannot
avoid demonstrating to you—dogmatically
once more—what our hypothesis is in this
respect. You will remember that the “I” is
the outer, peripheral layer of the “It.” We
now assume that on this outermost surface of
the “I,” there is a peculiar device, a system, an
organ if you wish, by whose exclusive actuation
that phenomenon is created which we
call Consciousness. This organ may be actuated
from the outside—that is, our sensory
nerves may convey to it sensations of an outer
world—as well as from the inside, where first
it may perceive the sensations from the “It”
and, later on, the processes of the “I.”</p>

<p class="c009">“This is getting worse and worse, and more
<span class="pageno" id="Page_66">66</span>and more beyond my understanding. Did you
not invite me to discuss with you the question
of whether or no, medically trained laymen
should be permitted to apply psychoanalysis?
Why, then, all these ramblings of vague and
dark theories, whose correctness you will be
unable to prove to me?”</p>

<p class="c009">Only too well do I realize that I cannot
convince you. As that would be beyond all
possibilities, I have, therefore, surrendered
such intentions. Even when instructing our
own disciples in the theory of psychoanalysis,
we always observe how little impression we
make on them in the beginning. They accept
the analytical teachings with just as much
equanimity as any other abstractions which
have been fed to them. Some of them may
have the earnest desire to be convinced, but
there is no trace that they ever really are convinced.</p>

<p class="c009">We demand that anyone who intends to
analyse somebody else, should first submit to
an analysis. Only if in the course of this “self-analysis”—as
it is usually incorrectly called—a
<span class="pageno" id="Page_67">67</span>disciple experiences the truth of psychoanalytical
teachings on his own body—or
rather on his own soul—then, and only then,
he gains those convictions which later on will
guide him in his work as an analyst.</p>

<p class="c009">How, then, may I expect to convince you,
Mr. Referee, of the correctness of our theories,
especially as I can only give you an incomplete,
abbreviated, and, therefore, none
too lucid outline of psychoanalytical teachings,
without your being able to corroborate
it through your own experiences?</p>

<p class="c009">But such is not my intention at all! We are
not discussing here the question of whether
psychoanalysis is sense or nonsense, nor
whether the premises of psychoanalysis are
correct or full of grave fallacies. I am simply
presenting our theories to you, because in this
way it seems easiest to me to explain to you
what is the real essence of psychoanalysis,
what are its premises in reference to individual
patients, and just what the treatment is
that is administered to them. In this way, the
problem of lay-analyses is projected in a striking
<span class="pageno" id="Page_68">68</span>light. If you have followed me up to
now, you may rest assured that the worst is
over and that from now on, everything will
be much more comprehensible to you.</p>

<p class="c009">And now let me pause for a moment.</p>

<div>
  <span class="pageno" id="Page_69">69</span>
  <h3 class="c001">IV</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-capa0_0_6 c008">“I expect that, on the basis of psychoanalytical
theories, you will explain to
me how the development of a nervous ailment
may be conceived!”</p>

<p class="c009">I shall try. For this purpose, however, it is
necessary that we study our “I” and “It” from
a new point of view. We shall have to look
upon these two factors as to their dynamic
values, that is, in regard to the forces active in
and between them. You will remember that
previously we restricted ourselves to the description
of the psychical apparatus.</p>

<p class="c009">“I am only hoping that things won’t be so
impossible to grasp.”</p>

<p class="c009">I do not think so. As a matter of fact, I believe
that you will soon comprehend the whole
system. To start with, let us assume that those
forces which actuate the soul apparatus are
generated by the different organs of our system,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_70">70</span>as the result of important needs of our
body. Don’t forget what the poet-philosopher
Schiller once said:</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c013">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Until philosophy sublime,</div>
      <div class="line">Supremely rules the course of time,</div>
      <div class="line">The world, in oldest fashion,</div>
      <div class="line">By hunger moves, and passion.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c009">Hunger and Passion are two very powerful
agents!</p>

<p class="c009">The needs of our body which stimulate the
soul into action—actuate the soul, as I referred
to it before—we call urges.</p>

<p class="c009">It is these urges which fill the “It.” All
energies generated by the “It” were incepted
by these urges. The powers of the “I” have
no other origin either, inasmuch as they are
derived from the “It.”</p>

<p class="c009">What, now, do these urges want?</p>

<p class="c009">They want to be satisfied, that is, they endeavor
to create such situations whereby the
needs of our body are gratified.</p>

<p class="c009">As soon as any tension, created by our urges,
slackens simultaneously with the satisfied cravings
of our body, our Consciousness experiences
<span class="pageno" id="Page_71">71</span>a pleasurable sensation, whereas an intensification
of our urges will soon enough
result in decided displeasure. In accordance
with these fluctuations of pleasurable and distressing
sensations, our soul apparatus regulates
its activity. Thus, the rule of the Pleasure
Principle manifests itself.</p>

<p class="c009">Intolerable conditions develop in case the
urges of the “It” are not satisfied. Experience
proves that situations of complete gratification
can only be achieved in contact with the outer
world. Thus, that part of the “It” which faces
the outer world, i. e., the “I,” assumes its functions.
While the driving power is produced by
the “It,” it is the “I” which then assumes the
management, takes the steering wheel in hand,
so to speak, without which the coveted goal
could never be reached.</p>

<p class="c009">It is characteristic of the urges of the “It”
that they are always bent upon immediate,
rash gratification without ever attaining their
ends, but frequently exposing themselves to
severe harm. Therefore, it devolves upon the
“I” to forestall such failure, by mediating between
the reckless demands of the “It” and
<span class="pageno" id="Page_72">72</span>the practical outer world. Thus, the censorial
activity of the “I” makes itself felt in two
different directions.</p>

<p class="c009">On one hand, the “I,” assisted by that organ
which conveys to it the reactions of an outer
world, scans the horizon, as it were, in an attempt
to seize upon the most opportune moment
for a harmless gratification of the urges
prompting it. On the other hand, the “I” exerts
a restraining influence on the “It,” controlling
its “passions” and inducing its urges
to postpone their gratification, or modify
them, or renounce them for some compensation,
as the case may be.</p>

<p class="c009">Restraining the reckless “It” in such a way,
the “I” replaces the formerly predominant
Pleasure Principle with the so-called Reality
Principle which, although striving for the
same ends as the Pleasure Principle, nevertheless
considers such practical necessities as
the outer world imposes.</p>

<p class="c009">Later on, the “I” discovers that there is another
way of insuring gratification of urges
than adaptation to the outer world. This newly
discovered method consists of changing conditions
<span class="pageno" id="Page_73">73</span>in the outer world in such a way as to
bring about circumstances favorable for gratification.
This activity of the “I” constitutes its
most supreme achievement. Sufficient discernment
to perceive when it is opportune to stifle
passions and when it is opportune to either
face or fight the realities of the outer world is,
after all, the Alpha and Omega of practical
wisdom.</p>

<p class="c009">“As I understand you, the ‘It’ is by far the
stronger of the two. How, then, is it possible
that the ‘It’ will permit the weaker ‘I’ to hold
sway over it?”</p>

<p class="c009">The “I” is well in a position to exert such
influence over the “It,” provided its organization
and efficiency is in no way hampered. Besides,
access to all parts of the “It” must be
such as to enable the “I” to bear sufficient influence
on the “It.” There is no inherent opposition
between the “I” and the “It,” both belonging
together. In cases of normal health,
it is practically impossible to distinguish between
the two.</p>

<p class="c009">“All this appears quite clear to me. However,
what I cannot understand is that under
<span class="pageno" id="Page_74">74</span>such ideal conditions, there could be any
chance at all for disturbances to arise?”</p>

<p class="c009">You are perfectly right! As long as the “I”
discharges its duties fully, and its relations to
the “It” are maintained in a satisfactory manner,
no nervous disturbances will develop.
However, disturbances are liable to arise at
some unsuspected spot. This will not surprise
the well-informed pathologist, but merely confirms
the fact that the most essential developments
and evolvements contain the very germ
for diseased conditions and the break down of
functions.</p>

<p class="c009">“This is too learned for me! I cannot follow
you any more!”</p>

<p class="c009">I shall have to digress for a little. You will
admit that a human being is a puny, helpless
thing in comparison to that tremendous outer
world, full of destructive agencies. Any primitive
being who did not develop a sufficiently
strong “I” organisation, is subject to all these
“traumata.” Such a primitive being will
achieve no more than just a “blind” gratification
of its urges, frequently to be destroyed in
this way.</p>

<p class="c009"><span class="pageno" id="Page_75">75</span>The evolvement of an “I” is, most of all, a
step towards insuring maintenance of life.
Destruction as such does not teach anything.
But after overcoming a trauma successfully,
attention will be attracted by similar situations
and danger will be signalized by a fear affect—a
shortened reproduction of what was lived
through during the trauma. This reaction to
approaching danger results in an attempt at
flight, which is maintained until sufficient
strength is generated to oppose the danger
arising from the outer world in an active manner,
perhaps even by taking recourse to aggression.</p>

<p class="c009">“All this seems to be far, far different from
what you promised me.”</p>

<p class="c009">You don’t realize how close I have already
come to the fulfillment of my promise to you.
Even in such living beings who later on develop
an efficient “I” organisation, this “I” is
quite weak in the years of childhood and only
slightly different from the “It.”</p>

<p class="c009">And now, I ask you to visualize what would
happen in case this powerless “I” is actuated
by an urge arising from the “It”—an urge
<span class="pageno" id="Page_76">76</span>which the weak “I” would like to resist, because
it feels that a gratification of this urge
may involve danger, may result in a traumatic
situation, a collision with the outer world.</p>

<p class="c009">Alas, the weak “I” cannot sum up enough
strength to resist.</p>

<p class="c009">Then what?</p>

<p class="c009">Then, the “I” deals with the danger, arising
from an “It”-inspired urge, in exactly the
same way that an exterior danger would have
to be faced. The “I” makes an attempt at
flight, deserting this specific part of the “It”
and leaving it to its fate. It refuses all such assistance
as it usually renders to urges arising
from the “It.” We refer to such a case as a repression
of urges by the “I.”</p>

<p class="c009">For the time being, danger is thus parried,
but to confound inner and outer world is certain
to invite punishment. Running away
from oneself is a thing that cannot be done!
In a case of repression, the “I” succumbs to
the Pleasure Principle which it otherwise
strives to correct. Thus, it is the “I” upon
which damage is inflicted in such cases of repression.
This damage consists of the “I”
<span class="pageno" id="Page_77">77</span>experiencing a lasting restriction in its own
sphere of rule. The repressed urge is now
isolated, left to itself, unapproachable, and
cannot be influenced. The repressed urge now
goes its own way. Frequently, even after the
“I” has attained power, it proves impossible
to release this repression. With its synthesis
disturbed, a part of the “It” remains forbidden
ground to the “I.”</p>

<p class="c009">The isolated urge does not remain idle,
however. Because normal gratification was
denied it, it contrives to compensate itself by
engendering psychical derivates which take its
place and, connecting with other psychical activations,
estrange them to the “I.” Finally, in
the form of an unrecognizable substitute, the
isolated urge penetrates to the “I” and to consciousness,
presenting itself as what is known
as a “symptom.”</p>

<p class="c009">We now become aware of what a nervous
disturbance is. We perceive an “I” hampered
in its synthesis, unable to exert any influence
on certain parts of the “It.” In addition, the
“I” must renounce some of its inherent activities,
to avoid new collisions with the repressed
<span class="pageno" id="Page_78">78</span>urge. We perceive an “I” exhausting
itself in mostly unavailing defensive measures
against symptoms that are nothing other than
results of the repression. Moreover, it becomes
evident now that in the “It,” some urges have
assumed independence. They aim at their own
gratification without any concern for the
whole, subject only to such primitive psychology
as reigns in the lowermost depths of
the “It.”</p>

<p class="c009">Observing such a state of affairs, we face
the quite simple situation in which the “I,”
attempting to repress certain parts of the “It,”
proceeded in an utterly unsuitable manner.
Consequently, the “I” has failed in its intention
and now the “It” is taking revenge on the
“I.” This revenge of the “It” on the “I” resulted
in nothing less than a neurosis.</p>

<p class="c009">Accordingly, a neurosis is the result of a
conflict between the “I” and the “It,” a conflict—as
investigations will show—forced
upon the “I,” because the latter insisted on
maintaining its state of pliability, in reference
to an outer world. The conflict, in fact, is one
between the “It” and the outer world. However,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_79">79</span>because the “I,” faithful and true, takes
sides with the outer world, it becomes entangled
in this conflict of the “It” with the
outer world.</p>

<p class="c009">Note that the condition of nervous disturbances
is not induced by the conflict between
the “I” and the “It” but rather by the fact that
the “I,” for the purpose of settling this conflict,
availed itself of the unsuitable agent of
repression. As a rule, conflicts between reality
and the “It” are unavoidable, and it is a routine
task for the “I” to act as a mediator in
such cases. That in the case of this specific
conflict which we have under observation just
now, the “I” took recourse to repression as
agent, is due to the fact that at this time the
“I” was powerless and immature. After all,
repressions of lasting importance occur exclusively
during early childhood!</p>

<p class="c009">“What a roundabout route you are taking!
However, I shall heed your advice and will
try not to criticize you. You were going to
explain to me what psychoanalysis assumes to
be the reason for neurosis and how such conditions
may be combated. There are quite a number
<span class="pageno" id="Page_80">80</span>of questions which I shall ask you later
on. At present, I am tempted to venture a
theory based on your own trend of thought.</p>

<p class="c009">“You have pointed out to me this interrelation
between outer world, and the ‘I’ and the
‘It.’ As an indispensable condition for the
development of a neurosis, you have mentioned
the fact that the ‘I,’ on account of its
dependency on the outer world, opposes the
‘It.’ However, is not some other course for
the ‘I’ possible? For example, could not the
‘I,’ in such a conflict be simply swept off its
feet by the ‘It,’ so to speak, renouncing all
dependency on the outer world?</p>

<p class="c009">“What, then, happens in such a case?</p>

<p class="c009">“Of course, I have merely the conception
of the typical lay mind when it comes to
visualizing the development of mental diseases,
but it seems to me that such diseases
may be easily induced if the ‘I’ would really
decide to side with the ‘It.’ To all appearances,
such disregard for realities is the very
reason for mental diseases!”</p>

<p class="c009">Of course, I have thought of this myself. I
<span class="pageno" id="Page_81">81</span>even believe this assumption to be correct. But
in order to prove this hypothesis, quite a complicated
discussion would be necessary. Neurosis
and Psychosis, to all appearances, are
closely related to one another. However, at
some important point, they widely diverge
from each other. The partisanship of the “I”
with the “It,” in a case of conflict, may prove
to be the crossroad where the two seek different
directions. In both cases, the “It” would
persist in its character of blind obstinacy.</p>

<p class="c009">“But, pray, tell me what advice your theory
offers for the treatment of neurotic conditions?”</p>

<p class="c009">It is quite simple to describe our therapeutic
goal: We aim at restituting the “I” and liberating
it from its restrictions, restoring to the
“I” once more the sovereignty over the “It”
which it lost, on account of early repressions.
Psychoanalysis, in general, aims at this goal;
our whole technique strives for this end. It is
up to us to discover those repressions, to induce
the “I” to correct them with our assistance,
and to settle conflicts more satisfactory than
<span class="pageno" id="Page_82">82</span>by a mere flight. Inasmuch as these repressions
are part of our early childhood, psychoanalysis
must needs go back to those years of our
life.</p>

<p class="c009">The way to those mostly forgotten conflict
situations, which we must revive in the memory
of our “cases,” is pointed out to us by
symptoms, dreams, and “free associations” of
the patient. Of course, all these hints must
first be interpreted, translated, as it were, because
these symptoms and dreams, under the
influence of the psychology of the “It,” have
assumed various disguises which it is our purpose
to penetrate.</p>

<p class="c009">If a patient communicates to us certain
ideas, thoughts and memories after long hesitation
only, we feel safe in assuming that they
have some connection with his early repressions,
or are, at least, derivates of such. By encouraging
the patient to conquer his hesitancy
when talking to us, we are training his “I” to
overcome its tendency to “run away” and
rather face that early repression. At the end,
after we have been successful in reproducing
the situation which originally induced his repression,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_83">83</span>the complacency of the patient is
splendidly rewarded. The number of years
that have meanwhile elapsed prove to be all
in favor of the patient. What once scared his
immature “I” and threw it into panic and
flight, appears to the adult-strengthened “I”
nothing more than just a childish bugaboo.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-capa0_0_6 c008">“Everything you spoke of so far
pertained to psychology. Frequently it
sounded somewhat strange and far-fetched to
me and altogether none too clear. But at any
rate, everything you said was, if I may say so,
clean! I admit, without hesitation, that I have
never had more than just superficial information
in regard to psychoanalysis. However, I
have been told, time and again, that your psychoanalysis
deals for the most part, with
things to which generally the word ‘clean’
may not be applied readily.</p>

<p class="c009">“To be quite frank with you: I have a slight
suspicion that, up to now, you have intentionally
avoided to touch upon this phase of
psychoanalysis.</p>

<p class="c009">“There is still another doubt in my mind
which I cannot suppress:—Neuroses, as you
said yourself, are the result of disturbances of
our soul life. How is it possible, then, that such
<span class="pageno" id="Page_85">85</span>important factors as our ethics, our conscience,
our ideals, apparently do not enter at all into
the development of these far-reaching disturbances?”</p>

<p class="c009">I understand you quite well. It appears to
you that in the information I have given you
so far, I have attached insufficient importance
to the most vulgar, as well as the most sublime
aspects of the matter. The reason for this is
simply that, up to now, we have not spoken
about the substance of psychical life at all.</p>

<p class="c009">For once, permit me to delay the progress
of our conversation.</p>

<p class="c009">I have told you so much about psychology,
in order that you may see that our analysis is
just a part of applied psychology; to be sure,
that part of psychology which is unknown
beyond the field of analysis. From this, it follows
that it must be the first task of the Analyst
to become acquainted with the Psychology of
the Depths, or Psychology of the Unconscious,
to the very extent it is known today. It will be
well to bear this fact in mind, as we shall later
on refer to it.</p>

<p class="c009">And now, I wish you would explain what
<span class="pageno" id="Page_86">86</span>you meant when referring to the lack of
“cleanliness” in psychoanalysis?</p>

<p class="c009">“Well, the general impression which prevails
is that, in the course of the analysis; the
most intimate and the most revolting phases of
sex life are aired with all their sordid details.
Of course, I do not draw this conclusion from
the lecture on psychology you have given me
so far! But if this is really true, it would
constitute a strong argument in favor of the
demand that the practice of psychoanalysis
should be restricted to physicians. How else
would it be possible to confide such details to
persons whose discretion may be open to
doubt, and whose character may not warrant
such frankness on the part of a patient?”</p>

<p class="c009">It is true enough that physicians are privileged
characters, as regards sexual matters.
In our times, physicians may even examine
sex organs, a prerogative denied to them in
the dark ages.</p>

<p class="c009">However, you wished to know whether
sexual matters play an important part in
psychoanalysis.</p>

<p class="c009">They do!</p>

<p class="c009"><span class="pageno" id="Page_87">87</span>There is a necessity for this because, in the
first place, frankness is an indispensable condition
for the efficacy of the analysis. But don’t
forget that, in the course of an analysis, the
patient will be just as frank in financial matters.
He will give details which he otherwise
would withhold, not only from the tax collector
and his competitors, but practically
from everybody. That such frankness on the
part of the patient puts the analyst under a
heavy obligation, imposing upon him a severe
moral responsibility, I surely do not deny, but
rather stress energetically.</p>

<p class="c009">The second necessity for airing the sex life
in psychoanalysis is proved by the established
fact that, among the reasons and causes for
nervous disturbances, phases of the sex life
play a tremendously important, a most essential
part; they may even prove to be the specific
reason of such disturbances.</p>

<p class="c009">Could psychoanalysis, under such circumstances,
do anything else than adapt itself to
this state of affairs? The analyst never persuades
his patient to venture into the realm of
sex. He will never tell a patient in advance:
<span class="pageno" id="Page_88">88</span>intimacies of your sex life are involved here!
The analyst permits the patient to start where
he feels inclined to start, encouraging him to
roam in any fashion that suits his fancy, waiting
calmly for the patient himself to touch
upon sex matters.</p>

<p class="c009">It is one of my strictest rules to remind my
disciples time and again: Our opponents are
reiterating continuously that we shall run
across cases in which the sexual moment does
not play any part whatever. Therefore, beware
of introducing it into the analysis! Do not let
us spoil the possibility of really discovering
cases, in which there is no sexual moment. To
be sure, up to now, we have never been fortunate
enough to detect such a case.</p>

<p class="c009">Of course, I know very well that the recognition
we give sex life is—admitted or not—the
strongest argument of those who oppose
the analysis. But is this fact liable to make us
waver in our scientific convictions? An argument
of this kind only proves how widespread
neurosis is in civilized life, when allegedly
normal people behave so very much
like nervous people.</p>

<p class="c009"><span class="pageno" id="Page_89">89</span>At a time when learned societies, with
much pomp and circumstance, used to sit in
judgment on psychoanalysis—they are not doing
it so frequently today!—one of the speakers
once commanded special attention as an
authority because, according to his statement,
he permitted his patients to talk about their
ailments. Apparently, he indulged in such
tolerance for reasons of diagnosis, and for the
purpose of checking up analytical claims. But,
this great authority added, as soon as patients
start to discuss sex matters, I shut them up!</p>

<p class="c009">How does such a procedure strike you?</p>

<p class="c009">I regret to report that the learned audience
applauded the great authority fervently, instead
of denouncing him, which would have
been more fitting. That loose logic in which
the aforementioned authority permitted himself
to revel, I can only explain by assuming
that he was all puffed up with that strength
which the knowledge of mutual prejudice
lent him.</p>

<p class="c009">In the course of years, some of my disciples,
following a popular trend, undertook to liberate
the world from the bonds of sex which
<span class="pageno" id="Page_90">90</span>psychoanalysis is supposed to force upon it.
One of them came out with the pronunciamento
that sex, in the broad meaning of the
term, does not mean sexuality as such, but
rather something abstract, something quite
mysterious. Another even emphatically declared
that sex life was just one of the different
phases in which man manifests his inherent
driving force for power and rule. These new
doctrines received public acclaim—at least
for a time.</p>

<p class="c009">“I strongly feel like taking sides in this issue.
It seems somewhat far-fetched to me to
insist that sexuality is not a natural, innate
necessity for all living beings, but rather the
expression for something else. Just look upon
the animal world!”</p>

<p class="c009">That does not matter! There is nothing absurd
enough that society would not gleefully
swallow, if it only pretends to be an antidote
against the overpowering might of sex.</p>

<p class="c009">By the way, may I not tell you that, to my
mind, your present status as an impartial listener,
a lay arbitrator, as it were, should not
permit you to betray the strong prejudice you
<span class="pageno" id="Page_91">91</span>yourself are manifesting, in regard to the
great part the sexual moment plays in the development
of neurotic conditions! Do you not
think that such a strongly emphasized prejudice
may make it impossible for you to render
a just verdict?</p>

<p class="c009">“I am very sorry to hear you say that! Apparently,
you have lost confidence in me. But,
pray, tell me, why did you not appeal to some
other impartial referee?”</p>

<p class="c009">For the simple reason that this other impartial
referee would not have thought any
differently from you. And in case he would
have been ready to admit at once the importance
of sex life, everybody would have
howled: He is no impartial referee at all!
He is one of your own camp followers!</p>

<p class="c009">No, I am not the least discouraged and I
am not abandoning hope that I shall ultimately
succeed in influencing your views. I
will admit, however, that the present case is
different from the one I have previously alluded
to. As far as orthodox psychological
argumentation was concerned, it did not matter
much for me whether you believed what I
<span class="pageno" id="Page_92">92</span>said or not. It was merely important to impress
you with the fact that purely psychological
problems were being dealt with. However,
when the question of sex is raised, it seems
important to prove to you that the strongest
reason for your opposition is nothing but a
general animosity toward sex, which you have
in common with many others.</p>

<p class="c009">“Do not forget that I lack the experiences
upon which your firm convictions are based.”</p>

<p class="c009">Very well, then. I shall proceed.</p>

<p class="c009">Sex life is not only something piquant, but
also a very serious scientific problem. Many
new facts had to be ascertained in this phase
of life, many peculiarities. I have already explained
to you that it is necessary for the
analysis to go back to the years of early childhood
because at this time, with an immature
“I,” still weak, the essential repressions of a
patient are incepted. But childhood has no
sex life;—sex life enters with puberty only, is
the general claim.</p>

<p class="c009">Wrong!</p>

<p class="c009">We have discovered that sexual tendencies
<span class="pageno" id="Page_93">93</span>permeate life from very birth. We also ascertained
that it is to combat these urges that the
infantile “I” resorts to repressions. It is indeed
remarkable, is it not, that even the wee
babe fights against the very same sexuality
against which that learned great authority
talked before an equally learned audience;—and
later on, those of my own disciples, even,
who compiled some new theories!</p>

<p class="c009">How is that possible?</p>

<p class="c009">The most platitudinous explanation would
be that our whole civilization unfolded at the
expense of sexuality. However, there is much
more to be said about this.</p>

<p class="c009">That only now the sexuality of the child
has been discovered, ought to drive the blush
of shame into our faces. Of course, there were
always some specialists of children’s diseases,
some baby-wise nurses who knew about it. On
the other hand, men, calling themselves “child
psychologists,” in the face of these findings,
raised a hue and cry and, wringing their hands
in desperation, spoke reproachfully of the
“Defloration of Childhood!”</p>

<p class="c009"><span class="pageno" id="Page_94">94</span>Again and again, sentiment instead of argument!
Such tactics are generally resorted
to in the course of political discussions.</p>

<p class="c009">Of course, the sex life of the child is different
from that of the adult. Sexual functions,
from the very beginning until they assume
those ultimate forms which are well known to
us, undergo a process of complicated development.
Many component urges, each driving
in a different direction, eventually consolidate,
ultimately to serve the purpose of propagation.</p>

<p class="c009">Not all of the individual component urges
prove of equal value, in view of the ultimate
task they are called upon to serve. Many
of them have to be “re-routed,” refashioned,
partially subdued. Such a protracted process
of development cannot always be pursued
smoothly, without obstacles arising here and
there and without engendering partial fixations
in the course of the earlier stages.
Wherever, in later life, sexual functions are
blocked by obstacles of some kind, sexuality—the
libido, as we call it—will show a decided
<span class="pageno" id="Page_95">95</span>tendency to gravitate towards such early
fixations.</p>

<p class="c009">The study of the sex life of the child and
its transformations, until full maturity, has
also yielded to us the key for the understanding
of so-called sexual perversions. These,
while generally spoken of with profound disgust,
up to then had remained obscure as to
their origin. Although this phase of sex life
is extraordinarily interesting, it does not serve
our present purpose to dwell upon it in detail.
To understand all these ramifications of sex
life, it is not only necessary to possess sufficient
anatomical and physiological information,
but also that knowledge which cannot
be acquired in medical schools, i. e., a thorough
acquaintance with the history of civilization
and mythology.</p>

<p class="c009">“Up to now, I am still unable to gain a
clear conception of the sex life of the child.”</p>

<p class="c009">I shall, then, dwell on this phase further.
To be perfectly frank with you, I should really
hate not to go into it further.</p>

<p class="c009">The most remarkable thing in the sex life
<span class="pageno" id="Page_96">96</span>of the child, to my mind, is the fact that its
whole, extensive development is completed in
the course of the first five years of life. From
then, until the beginning of puberty, there is
a time when sex remains latent, a time during
which—normally—sexuality is not progressing
but rather losing in intensity. During
these years, the child is liable to abandon and
forget much that he has practised and known
before.</p>

<p class="c009">It is during this period after the first bloom
of sex life has withered, that such conceptions
of the “I” develop as shame, disgust, morality,
destined to serve as support later on, in the
storm and stress of puberty, and to direct
newly awakened sexual tendencies. This new,
second phase of sex life plays a very important
part in the inception of nervous disturbances.
Apparently, it is only in man that this twofold
onset of sex life prevails. It is, perhaps,
this which is one of the contributing
factors to the truly human prerogative to indulge
in neuroses.</p>

<p class="c009">Before the advent of psychoanalysis, the
early period of sex life had been overlooked,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_97">97</span>just as had the unconscious background of conscious
soul life. If you should now suspect
that both belong together, you have guessed
correctly.</p>

<p class="c009">There is abundant material, of the greatest
interest as to contents, manifestations, and
performances of this early period of sex life,—material,
as a matter of fact, that would
prove most astonishing.</p>

<p class="c009">For example: It will amaze you, no doubt,
when I tell you that the baby boy is frequently
afraid of being devoured by his father. (Does
it not surprise you that I list this fear among
the manifestations of sex?)</p>

<p class="c009">Let me remind you here of the mythological
character of the god Cronus, who eats
his own children. How this myth must have
astounded you, when it was related to you
for the first time! Most probably, you,
like the rest of us, did not pause to ponder
over it.</p>

<p class="c009">Today, we frequently recognize, in such
fairytale characters as the carnivorous wolf
in Little Red Riding Hood, the child-devouring
father in disguise. Let me assure
<span class="pageno" id="Page_98">98</span>you that mythology, as well as the world of
fairytales, can be understood only on the basis
of the sex life of the child.</p>

<p class="c009">It may also surprise you to learn that the
male child is beset with fears of having his
father rob him of his sex organ, and that this
fear of being castrated is of the greatest influence,
in connection with the general development
of a male child’s character and his
sexual tendencies, in later life.</p>

<p class="c009">Here is another case where psychoanalysis
may draw upon mythology for support. Remember
that the same Cronus who devoured
his own children, also emasculated his own
father Uranos, to be castrated, in revenge, by
his son Zeus, who had been saved through the
perspicacity of his mother.</p>

<p class="c009">In case you are inclined to believe that all
that which has been said about the early sexuality
of children is just a phantasmagoria
of the wild fancies of a psychoanalyst, you
must nevertheless admit that these wild fancies
are very similar to those ideas which permeated
the phantasy of primitive man, of
<span class="pageno" id="Page_99">99</span>which myths and fairytales are the tangible
record.</p>

<p class="c009">Does it not seem more acceptable and more
probable that in the soul life of present-day
children, the same archaic moments still prevail,
which generally prevailed at the time
of primitive civilization? To all appearances,
the child, in the development of his soul,
simply recapitulates the evolution of his species,
analogous to the recapitulation of his
physical development, which has long since
been accepted by embryology.</p>

<p class="c009">Another characteristic of the early sexual
life of the male child is that the female sex
organ as such does not play any part in it; it
has not been discovered for him yet. All interest
is directed to the male organ, all attention
concentrated on the question of whether
this organ is really existent.</p>

<p class="c009">We know less about the early sex life of the
female child than about that of the male offspring,—a
fact not so surprising since the
sex life of even the mature woman still presents
a “dark continent” to psychology. Nevertheless,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_100">100</span>we know that the female child is extremely
sensitive about the lack of a sex organ
equal to that of the male child. Accordingly,
the girl comes to consider herself inferior to
the boy, developing a condition of “Penis
Envy,” from which may be traced a whole
chain of reactions characteristic of the female.</p>

<p class="c009">Another characteristic of the child is that
excremental discharges of the body are drawn
into the sphere of sexual interest. To be sure,
education eventually draws a strict line of
demarkation here. Later in life, however, this
demarkation line is wiped out, when the
stage of “off-color jokes” sets in. Although this
may be distasteful to us it is, nevertheless,
well known that the child requires some time,
before he develops a sense of disgust. Even
those who insist upon the seraphic purity of a
child’s soul have never dared to deny this fact.</p>

<p class="c009">No other manifestation in the sex life of the
child is more important than the fact that
sexual desires of a child always aim at persons
most closely related to him. Such inclinations
lean primarily toward the father and the
mother; secondarily, toward sisters and brothers.
<span class="pageno" id="Page_101">101</span>While for the boy, the mother is the
first object of love, for the girl it is the father,
unless bisexual tendencies favor different inclinations.
That parent toward whom the
sexual tendencies of the child do not gravitate,
comes to be considered a disturbing rival and
thus, not too rarely, becomes the object of intense
enmity.</p>

<p class="c009">Be sure to understand me correctly. I do
not mean to say that the child is bent upon
receiving from the favored parent, only such
demonstrations of affection which we adults
are wont to consider the very essence of a
beautiful relationship between parent and
child. In the light of psychoanalysis, there is
no doubt that the child desires much more
than merely these demonstrations of parental
affection. As a matter of fact, the child desires
that which we conceive as sensual gratification,
though naturally, only to the limited extent
of the child’s understanding.</p>

<p class="c009">It is obvious enough that the child never
surmises the real facts as to the actual physical
relations of the sexes, but this ignorance is
compensated by impressions and experiences
<span class="pageno" id="Page_102">102</span>deducted from his own observations. Usually,
a child’s desires culminate in the wish to give
birth to a baby, or beget one, in some vague
manner.</p>

<p class="c009">Even the little boy, in his ignorance, has this
desire to give birth to a child.</p>

<p class="c009">Such manifestations, in their entirety, are
termed, in accordance with Greek mythology,
Œdipus Complex.</p>

<p class="c009">Normally, an Œdipus Complex should be
abandoned or thoroughly changed, simultaneously
with the termination of early sex life.
The results of this transformation of the Œdipus
Complex are destined to bring about great
achievements, to play a big part in later soul
life.</p>

<p class="c009">As a rule, this transformation is not thorough
enough. Therefore, during the period
of puberty, the Œdipus Complex may be
revived, in which case it is liable to induce
dire results.</p>

<p class="c009">I am very much surprised that you are still
silent. Could this mean agreement?</p>

<p class="c009">No doubt, if psychoanalysis maintains that
the first sexual desires of a child are of incestuous
<span class="pageno" id="Page_103">103</span>nature, to apply a technical term, there
is no question that psychoanalysis has again
trodden upon humanity’s holiest feelings, thus
once more incurring accusations, disbelief,
and opposition.</p>

<p class="c009">Psychoanalysis always had to face grave incriminations,
but nothing has robbed psychoanalysis
of a favorable opinion on the part of
its contemporaries more than the conception
of the Œdipus Complex, as a general human
characteristic, decreed by fate.</p>

<p class="c009">To be sure, Greek mythology must have
similarly interpreted the Œdipus situation,
but the majority of our contemporaries—be
they learned or not—prefer to believe that nature
herself has endowed us with an inborn
disgust, as a protection against the possibility
of an incestuous trend.</p>

<p class="c009">But here we may refer to history for corroboration.
When Cæsar met Egypt’s youthful
queen, soon to play such an important part in
his life, Cleopatra was married to her younger
brother Ptolemy. This was nothing extraordinary
in Egyptian dynastic tradition. The
Ptolemæëns, originally of Greek extraction,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_104">104</span>had simply continued a custom practised for
thousands of years by their predecessors, the
old Pharaohs. Incestuous relationships, a common
practice at that time, were after all, only
between brother and sister, which even today
evokes a comparatively mild judgment. But
let us turn to our most important witness—mythology—for
conditions, as they prevailed
in primitive times.</p>

<p class="c009">Mythology records that the myths, not
only of the Greeks, but of all nations, supply
an over-abundance of amorous relations between
father and daughter, and even between
mother and son; cosmology, as well as genealogy,
of royal families was founded on incest.</p>

<p class="c009">According to your mind, what was the underlying
reason for the creation of this lore?
Was it to brand gods and kings as criminals,
to invite the disgust of mankind upon their
heads?</p>

<p class="c009">It was rather that the gratification of incestuous
desires—an ancient, human heritage,
never completely overcome—was still permissible
for gods and their offspring, although
renounced by the majority of common mortals.</p>

<p class="c009"><span class="pageno" id="Page_105">105</span>From this, it would appear, that incestuous
desires, in the childhood of the individual, are
in complete harmony with the teachings of
history and mythology.</p>

<p class="c009">“I am glad that you did not stand by your
original intention to withhold from me all this
information, in regard to the sex life of the
child, inasmuch as it throws a very interesting
light on the more primitive stage of humanity.”</p>

<p class="c009">I was afraid that in so doing, I might digress
too far. But, after all, it may prove of advantage
that you have these informations now.</p>

<p class="c009">“But tell me, what proofs have you, from
an analytical point of view, of the sex life of
the child? Is your conviction founded merely
on the corroboration that mythology and history
offer?”</p>

<p class="c009">Not at all! Our conviction rests upon direct
observations. Here is how we arrived at our
conclusions:—In the first place, sex life of
childhood was revealed to us in the analysis
of adults, who volunteered this information.
Then, we proceeded to analyse children, and
it was no small triumph when we succeeded in
<span class="pageno" id="Page_106">106</span>proving everything which we had deducted
from the information of adults, despite the
fact that as regarded the adults, twenty to forty
years had passed, during which time these
memories had been submerged and undergone
substantial changes.</p>

<p class="c009">“What! You really ventured to analyse
little children, tots of less than six years? How
could such a thing be done at all? And wasn’t
that hazardous, as far as the children were
concerned?”</p>

<p class="c009">It was easy enough to do.</p>

<p class="c009">You would hardly believe what takes place
in the brain of a child of four or five years. At
this age, children are mentally very alert. For
them, the period of early sexuality is also a
period of intellectual bloom. I am under the
impression that children, with the beginning
of the period of latency, experience a mental
let-down; grow temporarily dull, so to speak.
During this period, many children also begin
to lose their physical charm.</p>

<p class="c009">As far as possible damage, arising from an
early analysis is concerned, let me assure you
that the first child to undergo this experiment—about
<span class="pageno" id="Page_107">107</span>twenty years ago—has meanwhile
grown up to be a sound and efficient young
man who, despite severe psychological traumata,
passed through his pubescent period
without complaint. This fact encourages me
to expect that all the other “victims” will not
fare any worse.</p>

<p class="c009">Analyses of children yield various interesting
results. Possibly, in future, they will grow
in importance. As far as theoretical findings
are concerned, there can be no doubt as to the
value of these analyses. As children give unequivocal
information on questions which only
yield hazy results in the analyses of adults, the
analyst is protected against mistakes which
might have proved to be serious. Analyses of
children have the added advantage, in that
those moments are seized upon unaware, when
a neurosis is in the process of development.
There can be no mistake about such observations
in children.</p>

<p class="c009">To be sure, in the interest of the child, it is
necessary to combine analytical influence with
educational measures. This is a technique still
to be perfected. There is practical interest attached
<span class="pageno" id="Page_108">108</span>to this problem, because observations
prove that a great number of our children,
during their period of development, pass
through a clearly discernable neurotic phase.
Ever since we perceived these things more
keenly, we have been tempted to venture that
neurotic conditions of children are not the exception,
but rather the rule. It appears that in
view of infantile tendencies to neuroses, such
trend of developments cannot be avoided in
the course of civilisatoric progress. In most
cases, such neurotic taints are spontaneously
thrown off during childhood. The question
remains, however, whether traces of them are
not frequently left, even in such individuals
as are considered of average health.</p>

<p class="c009">On the other hand, there is no neurotic adult
in whom infantile tendencies toward neuroses
cannot be discerned, although originally they
may not necessarily have been so very obvious.
Analogous to this, specialists for internal diseases
claim, I believe, that every individual
during the time of his childhood passes
through a tubercular condition.</p>

<p class="c009">Let me return to your question of proofs.</p>

<p class="c009"><span class="pageno" id="Page_109">109</span>From direct analytical observation of children,
we concluded that in general the information
which adults had given us, in reference
to their childhood, had been correctly
interpreted by us. In some cases, it was even
possible to obtain confirmation of a different
kind. For example:—From material unearthed
by the analysis, it was possible to reconstruct
certain occurrences and impressive
events of childhood, of which the conscious
memory of the patient was no longer aware.
Fortunate accidents or information supplied
by parents and educators yielded unquestionable
proof that the analyst had correctly reconstructed
these impressions and experiences
of childhood.</p>

<p class="c009">Such proof, of course, could not be obtained
very frequently, but whenever it was obtained,
it created an overpowering impression. You
must know that the correct reconstruction of
such forgotten experiences of childhood always
results in a tremendous therapeutic
effect, no matter whether such reconstructions
may be objectively confirmed or not. The importance
attached to these events is naturally
<span class="pageno" id="Page_110">110</span>derived from the fact that these experiences
occurred in early childhood, when they could
still affect the feeble “I” traumatically.</p>

<p class="c009">“What may those events be which analysis
must unearth for therapeutic purposes?”</p>

<p class="c009">Events of various nature.</p>

<p class="c009">In the first place, impressions strong enough
to permanently influence the awakening sex
life of the child, such as observation of sexual
intercourse between adults or personal sexual
experiences with an adult or some other child—occurrences
not at all rare. Then, overhearing
the conversation of adults, at a time when
the child did not fully comprehend the significance,
but which, when the child came
to grasp the real meaning, conveyed to him
knowledge to be coveted because of the air of
secrecy and mystery attached to it. Furthermore,
utterances and actions of the child himself,
demonstrating a decidedly tender or else
hateful inclination toward other persons. It is
of special importance, in the course of the
analysis, to revive cases of forgotten personal
sexual indulgence, and the interference of
<span class="pageno" id="Page_111">111</span>adults which served to terminate these habits.</p>

<p class="c009">“It seems to be my turn, now, to ask a question
which I have had on my mind for a long
time. What do you call ‘sexual indulgence’ of
a child, during his period of early sexuality
which, as you say, is a time that was completely
overlooked before the advent of psychoanalysis?”</p>

<p class="c009">Of course that which is usual and essential
in this indulgence had not been overlooked.
This is not so remarkable, because it simply
couldn’t be overlooked. Sexual tendencies of
the child find their expression mainly in masturbation.
That this childish “naughtiness” is
extraordinarily common was always known to
adults. It is considered a grave sin, to be energetically
suppressed.</p>

<p class="c009">But please do not ask me how such “immoral”
tendencies in children—and children
admit that they indulge in them because they
give them pleasure!—can co-exist with that
inborn purity and non-sensuality of which we
love to prate. You had better ask our opponents
to solve this puzzle for you.</p>

<p class="c009"><span class="pageno" id="Page_112">112</span>A much more important problem is facing
us now:—What is the position to take towards
sexual indulgence in early childhood?</p>

<p class="c009">There is not the slightest doubt as to the responsibility
incurred by suppressing such actions
and, on the other hand, one dare not permit
it to go on, limitless.</p>

<p class="c009">It appears that sexuality of children is unrestricted
among peoples of low civilization and
in the lower strata of civilized people. Such
tolerance may amount to a strong protection
against the possibility of neuroses cropping up
in later years, but the question is whether there
does not then remain a concurrent, extraordinary
loss in regard to an individual’s aptness
for cultural achievements. It seems we are
facing a case of Scylla and Charybdis there.</p>

<p class="c009">However, I shall leave it to you to decide
whether such interest, as the study of sex life
may have for neurotics, would tend to create
an atmosphere, favorable for the awakening of
libidinous desires.</p>

<div>
  <span class="pageno" id="Page_113">113</span>
  <h3 class="c001">VI</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-capa0_0_6 c008">“I think I know now what your intentions
are:—You wish to show me just
what knowledge is necessary for the practice
of psychoanalysis, so that I may be able to
judge whether physicians alone shall be permitted
to apply this method. Up to now, you
have mainly discussed psychology, and a little
biology or sex science, without a decided medical
slant. However, I may not have heard
everything yet.”</p>

<p class="c009">Certainly not. There are still a number of
gaps to be filled. But may I ask you a favor?
Will you be good enough to describe to me
how you imagine psychoanalytical treatment
is applied? Just pretend as if it were up to you
to analyse a patient.</p>

<p class="c009">“Well, I may make quite a mess of this! It
is surely not my intention to settle the argument
between us, on the basis of such an experiment.
However, I shall do as you ask.
<span class="pageno" id="Page_114">114</span>After all, the responsibility falls upon your
shoulders.</p>

<p class="c009">“Now then: I assume that the patient comes
to see me and embarks upon a recital of his
complaints. I promise him to cure, or at least
improve, his condition, provided that he will
follow my instructions. Then, I would ask him
to tell me, in all frankness, what he knows,
what ideas enter his mind. I should also request
him to make a clean breast of everything,
even though there may be things which he
would hate to mention. Am I adhering to your
methods?”</p>

<p class="c009">You are! But, in addition you should have
the patient tell you all his thoughts, even if
they seem unimportant to him or lacking in
sense.</p>

<p class="c009">“Very well.—The patient, then, starts to relate
his story and I listen. And what next? Oh,
yes, his information will make it possible for
me to conclude what impressions, experiences
and desires he may have repressed, because
he came face to face with them at a time when
his ‘I’ was still weak and too intimidated to
face the dilemma squarely.</p>

<p class="c009"><span class="pageno" id="Page_115">115</span>“After I have told that to the patient, he
will reconstruct the old situations and correct
his reactions to them with my assistance. Thus,
the repressions, his ‘I’ had been forced to resort
to, will disappear and he is cured.—Is that
correct?”</p>

<p class="c009">Very good, indeed.—I already foresee that
more people are going to reproach me for having
trained a non-medical man to practise
psychoanalysis. I surely must admit that you
digested what I told you.</p>

<p class="c009">“I have only repeated what you told me,
like reciting something that has been committed
to memory.</p>

<p class="c009">“But I do not feel able to clearly visualize
how I really would go about it. I cannot understand
why such an analysis should require
an hour or more a day, for a period of months.
As a rule, the average human being has not
met with so many experiences. And as far as
repressions during childhood are concerned,
I assume that these are probably identical in
all cases.”</p>

<p class="c009">There are many new experiences to make in
the course of an analysis.</p>

<p class="c009"><span class="pageno" id="Page_116">116</span>For example: You would find that it is not
so simple at all, from the information a patient
may volunteer, to draw conclusions as to those
of his experiences which he has forgotten, the
urges which he once repressed.</p>

<p class="c009">A patient may tell you something which, at
the moment, has just as little sense for you as
for him. You will have to make up your mind
that the material which the patient lays before
you, in accordance with the instruction you
gave him, must be interpreted in a special way.
Analogous, perhaps, to the treatment iron ore
receives for the purpose of extracting from it
valuable steel by some special process. In retaining
this picture, for the purpose of comparison,
you must know that tons and tons of
iron ore contain only very little of the valuable
steel for which you are looking. This is one
reason which would account for the fact that
psychoanalytical treatment is such a long
drawn-out process.</p>

<p class="c009">“But how is this ‘iron ore’ to be converted,
to apply your comparison once more?”</p>

<p class="c009">By assuming that the information and ideas
of a patient are nothing but distorted pictures
<span class="pageno" id="Page_117">117</span>of those impressions and experiences you are
trying to unearth. Hints, as it were, from
which you would have to conclude what is
really behind them. To press it into a formula:
the information a patient yields, be it memories,
ideas or dreams, will have to be interpreted
first. This interpretation, of course,
must be guided by the expectations you
formed of the case on the basis of professional
knowledge, while listening to the patient’s recital.</p>

<p class="c009">“‘Interpretation’! What a dreadful word!
I do not like to hear this term because, in applying
it, you are depriving me of all confidence.
If everything depends on my interpretation,
who is going to assure me that my
interpretation is correct? Such a state of affairs,
according to my mind, simply means
that everything is left to fancies and whims.”</p>

<p class="c009">Just a moment, now! Things are not as bad
as all that. Why exclude processes of your own
soul from the same rule which you are ready
to admit to that of others?</p>

<p class="c009">Provided you have acquired a certain self-discipline
and are in the possession of sufficient
<span class="pageno" id="Page_118">118</span>information, your interpretations will
not be influenced by personal peculiarities, and
are bound to prove correct.</p>

<p class="c009">Do not draw the conclusion from this that
it is my opinion that the personality of the
analyst does not make any difference, for this
phase of the analysis. A certain sensitiveness
for that which was unconsciously repressed, is
necessary; also an aptness with which everybody
is not equally endowed. Most of all, it
is here where the absolute necessity for a
thorough and searching self-analysis of the
analyst is proved, for the purpose of precluding
any prejudice that may drag a distorted
element into the interpretation.</p>

<p class="c009">One thing, of course, still remains: Personal
Equation, which, as an element of individuality,
is destined to play a much more important
part in psychoanalysis than anywhere else.
Although an abnormal man may develop into
an expert physicist, an analyst will always be
handicapped by his own anomalies, when it
comes to conceive pictures of soul life, free
from distortions.</p>

<p class="c009">Inasmuch as it is impossible to prove to
<span class="pageno" id="Page_119">119</span>anybody his anomalies, general unanimity in
the matter of Psychology of the Depths will
prove especially difficult to achieve. There are
even a handful of psychologists who claim it
to be practically impossible ever to achieve
such unanimity, and who also insist that every
fool is entitled to proclaim his special brand
of foolishness as wisdom.</p>

<p class="c009">I admit I am more optimistically inclined.
After all, our experiences prove that, even
in psychology, harmony of opinion may be
achieved to a tolerably satisfactory degree. No
doubt, each individual realm of science presents
its own individual difficulties which have
to be eliminated. Moreover, there are some aspects
of the art of interpretation, as applied
in analysis which, like some other knowledge,
may be acquired by study. For example, those
aspects pertaining to the peculiarly indirect
representation by symbols.</p>

<p class="c009">“To be frank with you: I have lost all ambition,
even to dabble theoretically with the
application of psychoanalysis. Heaven knows
what further surprises are still in store for
me!”</p>

<p class="c009"><span class="pageno" id="Page_120">120</span>You are perfectly correct to abandon such
an intention.</p>

<p class="c009">You have already convinced yourself how
much training and practice is necessary. And
once you have found the correct interpretations,
a new problem presents itself. It is then
up to you to lay in wait and virtually pounce
upon the correct, the psychological moment,
if you wish to acquaint your patient of your
interpretations with the idea of benefiting
him.</p>

<p class="c009">“How to tell what is the psychological moment?”</p>

<p class="c009">That is a matter of extreme tact which, by
the way, may be greatly improved through experience.
You would commit a very grave error
if you would fling your interpretation, as
soon as it had been ascertained, at the patient.
This would only lead to resistance, refusal, indignation,
but never result in his “I” getting a
firm hold of whatever it was that caused his
repressions. It is an iron clad rule to permit
your patient to approach this elusive cause of
repression close enough, to make it possible
for him to obtain an immediate and strong
<span class="pageno" id="Page_121">121</span>grip on it, under the correctly timed guidance
of the interpretation you may suggest.</p>

<p class="c009">“I am very much afraid that I would never
master this art. But suppose that I observe this
rule strictly, then what?”</p>

<p class="c009">Then it will be your lot to make a discovery
which you did not expect to make.</p>

<p class="c009">“What kind of a discovery?”</p>

<p class="c009">That you had an entirely wrong opinion
about your patient. That there is no reason in
the world for you to depend on his coöperation
or complacency. That, as a matter of fact,
your patient is resolved to raise as many obstacles
as possible against your combined exertions.
With one word: that he does not altogether
want to get well!</p>

<p class="c009">“Well, that is about the most ludicrous
statement you have made so far! I simply don’t
believe it! The patient, suffering so intensely,
complaining so heartrendingly, sacrificing so
much to be cured, actually does not want to
get well! Is it possible you really mean what
you say?”</p>

<p class="c009">I mean every word of it! What I have just
stated is the truth. Not the whole truth, but a
<span class="pageno" id="Page_122">122</span>good deal of it. The patient wants, yet does
not want, to get well. Because his “I” has lost
its unity of purpose, it is preventing him from
summing up undivided will power. Were the
state of affairs a different one, our patient
would not be a neurotic!</p>

<p class="c009">The results of his repression have simply invaded
his “I,” firmly holding their ground
there, so to speak. The “I” is wielding just as
little influence over these effects as over the repression
itself. Usually, the “I” is not at all
aware of the prevailing state of affairs. These
patients are of a peculiar type, putting difficulties
in our way which we do not expect to
encounter. All our social institutions are organized
to fit individuals with a unified, normal
“I,” which may be classified as either good
or bad. This “I” either functions properly, or
is impeded by some overwhelming influence.
Thus, the forensic alternative: mentally responsible
or not responsible.</p>

<p class="c009">But all these standard terms do not fit the
neurotic!</p>

<p class="c009">Doubtless, it is difficult to adapt the demands
of social life to their psychological condition.
<span class="pageno" id="Page_123">123</span>During the War, this was proved to a
great extent.</p>

<p class="c009">Were those neurotics who shirked from
military duty, pretending illness, simulants or
not?</p>

<p class="c009">They were both!</p>

<p class="c009">As soon as such patients were treated as
simulants, by making it uncomfortable for
them to indulge in sickness, they recuperated;
and as soon as allegedly cured patients had
been returned to the rank and file, they once
more became ill. There was simply no way to
deal effectively with them.</p>

<p class="c009">Analogous to this is the case of the neurotic
in everyday life.</p>

<p class="c009">They complain about their sickness, at the
same time exploiting it to the limit. As a matter
of fact, if an attempt is made to cure them
of their ailment, they will protect this most
cherished possession of theirs with the selfsame
fervor with which a lioness defends her
offspring. But there would be no sense in
blaming neurotics for the contradictory behavior
they display.</p>

<p class="c009">“Would it not be best, then, not to treat such
<span class="pageno" id="Page_124">124</span>difficult people at all? Simply leave them to
themselves? It seems to me that it cannot possibly
be worthwhile to spend as much effort on
them as appears necessary, according to what
you say.”</p>

<p class="c009">I do not agree with you on this point.</p>

<p class="c009">Doubtless, it seems wiser to simply submit
to the complications which life presents,
rather than to fight them. Not each and every
one of the neurotics we treat may be worth the
exertions of an analysis, but there are surely
enough worthwhile individuals among them.
It must be our goal to decrease the number of
persons who are forced to face the exasperations
of civilized life with a soul insufficiently
prepared. To this end, we must collect experience
upon experience, and come to fully
grasp many problems. Every analysis is bound
to prove instructive, yielding new knowledge,
aside from the personal benefit it may confer
upon an individual patient.</p>

<p class="c009">“Supposing that the ‘I’ of a patient developed
such tendencies which would make him
wish to retain the sickness of which he complains,
would not these tendencies be justified,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_125">125</span>on the basis of certain reasons and motives? It
is impossible for me to understand why somebody
should want to be sick. What satisfaction
could he derive from that?”</p>

<p class="c009">Just remember the war neurotics who were
exempt from duty, because they were considered
sick. In everyday life, sickness may
be successfully employed as a screen, behind
which to hide professional insufficiencies, or—in
the circle of family life—as a means to induce
relatives to make sacrifices, demonstrations
of affection, or to foist one’s will upon
them, generally. All this is quite obvious and
comes under the term “sickness profit” (analogous
to war profit). It is remarkable, however,
that the neurotic, or rather his “I,” proves unable
to grasp the connection of such motives
with their logical consequences.</p>

<p class="c009">The influence of such tendencies to gain
“sickness profit” is combated, by forcing the
“I” to become aware of them. But there are
still other, more obscure motives, for holding
on to sickness, which cannot be disposed so
easily. As a matter of fact, these reasons cannot
be understood, without venturing once
<span class="pageno" id="Page_126">126</span>more into the sphere of psychological theories.</p>

<p class="c009">“Oh, go right ahead! A little theory, more
or less—what does it matter?”</p>

<p class="c009">When I explained to you the relations between
the “I” and the “It,” I withheld from
you an important part of the soul apparatus.
You see, within the “I” itself, there persists
a particular faction which we call the “Super-Ego.”</p>

<p class="c009">This “Super-Ego” enjoys a privileged position
between the “I” and the “It.” It belongs
to the “I,” sharing with it its intricate psychological
make-up. On the other hand, it entertains
very close relations with the “It.” The
“Super-Ego” is in reality the record of first
impressions as conceived by the “It”; it is the
heir of the dissolved Œdipus Complex.</p>

<p class="c009">This “Super-Ego,” as a matter of fact, is
able to oppose the “I,” act towards it as if it
were something inferior and, in general, treat
it almost with contempt. For the “I” it is just
as important to remain in agreement with the
“Super-Ego” as with the “It.” Disagreement
between the “Super-Ego” and the “I” is of
far-reaching consequences for the soul life.</p>

<p class="c009"><span class="pageno" id="Page_127">127</span>Doubtless, you have already surmised that
the “Super-Ego” is the agent of that phenomenon
which we call our conscience.</p>

<p class="c009">For the maintenance of healthy soul life, it
is very important that the “Super-Ego” develop
normally, that is, becomes sufficiently
impersonal. It is just this development which
is insufficient in the neurotic, because his Œdipus
Complex was not properly transformed.
His “Super-Ego,” in regard to the “I,” still
assumes the rôle of the strict father to the
child, with the morality of the “I” manifesting
itself in a primitive manner by meekly submitting
to punishment, meted out by the “Super-Ego.”
Sickness is resorted to, as the means of
this “self-punishment.” The neurotic, behaving
as if under a burden of guilt accepts sickness
as a punishment to assuage this feeling of
delinquency.</p>

<p class="c009">“That sounds very mysterious. But the most
remarkable thing seems to be that the patient
remains unconscious of the power of his conscience.”</p>

<p class="c009">Well, we are only now beginning to appreciate
the importance of all these vital conditions.
<span class="pageno" id="Page_128">128</span>That is the reason why my explanations
were so puzzling to you. But now, I believe I
can continue.</p>

<p class="c009">All those agents which oppose the recuperation
of a patient, we term the “resistance” of
the patient. While “sickness profit” is the
source of such resistance, the “unconscious
feeling of guilt” represents the resistance of
the “Super-Ego” of which, as the strongest
factor, we are very much in fear.</p>

<p class="c009">But there are other manifestations of resistance
which become evident in the process of
treatment.</p>

<p class="c009">If the “I,” at an early period, was induced
through fear, to take recourse to a repression,
this fear still persists, manifesting itself now as
a resistance, as soon as the “I” approaches
that which was repressed. It is easy enough to
realize that difficulties may be encountered, if
a certain tendency, which for decades has proceeded
along a specific course, is suddenly expected
to swing into a new path opened to it.</p>

<p class="c009">Such a condition may be termed the resistance
of the “It.”</p>

<p class="c009">The battle against all these resistances is our
<span class="pageno" id="Page_129">129</span>main work during the analytical treatment, in
comparison with which the task of interpretation
almost fades into insignificance. But by
this battle and the ensuing defeat of resistances,
the “I” of the patient is so transformed
and strengthened that his future behavior,
after the termination of the treatment, may be
regarded with complete equanimity.</p>

<p class="c009">On the other hand, you will understand now
why our treatment is so protracted. Expanse
and multifariousness of the material are not
as decisive factors as the question of whether
the way is clear. Remember that the same
course, which in times of peace, may be traveled
in a few hours by railroad, may take an
army, during wartime, weeks and weeks, because
the resistance of the enemy must first be
overcome. Battles to overcome resistance require
time in soul life also. I am sorry to say
that, up to now, all exertions to shorten the
duration of analytical treatments to any appreciable
degree, have proved unavailing. It
seems that the best way to shorten the length of
the treatment, is simply to apply it as correctly
as possible.</p>

<p class="c009"><span class="pageno" id="Page_130">130</span>“If I ever felt the temptation to dabble with
your science and to attempt to analyze a patient,
your information in reference to those
resistances, that may be encountered, cured
me thoroughly of any such ambition.</p>

<p class="c009">“But, tell me about the element of personal
influence which you have admitted is present
in the analysis. Is this not a valuable factor in
the battle against resistance?”</p>

<p class="c009">I am glad that you bring this question up.
This personal influence is our strongest dynamic
weapon; it is the agent which we introduce
as something new, into the analytical
situation, thus lending it impetus.</p>

<p class="c009">This could never be accomplished by the
intellectual substance of our interpretation
alone because the patient, sharing all the prejudices
of his environment, need not have
more faith in us than our scientific critics. The
neurotic coöperates with the analyst simply
because he believes in him, and he believes in
him because he gradually develops a certain
sentimental trend toward the analyst. A child,
also, believes only persons to whom it is attached.</p>

<p class="c009"><span class="pageno" id="Page_131">131</span>I have already told you how we employ this
especially great “suggestive” influence. Not to
suppress the symptoms—it is here where the
analytical method is utterly unlike any other
psycho-therapeutical method!—but as a driving
power to induce the “I” of the patient to
defeat his resistances.</p>

<p class="c009">“And suppose you succeed? Would that insure
easy sailing from then on?”</p>

<p class="c009">Such ought to be the case. But an unexpected
complication arises.</p>

<p class="c009">It was perhaps the greatest surprise for the
analyst to observe that the sentimental relations
which the patient endeavors to establish,
are of a very particular nature. Already the
first physician who attempted analysis—it was
not I—discovered this phenomenon, which
served to bewilder him intensely. These sentimental
relations are, to express it bluntly, of
an amorous nature. Remarkable, isn’t it, if you
take into consideration the fact that the analyst
does nothing to invite such emotions, but
rather endeavors to maintain distance, sentimentally
speaking, between the patient and
himself.</p>

<p class="c009"><span class="pageno" id="Page_132">132</span>All this is so much more remarkable, as
these odd sentimental relations utterly disregard
all such obstacles, as difference in age,
sex, and social strata. This amorousness appears
fated. Not that it constitutes a characteristic
otherwise alien to spontaneous love. You
are well aware that the contrary of this may be
only too frequently observed. Although it is
the rule in the analytical situation, the latter,
as such, cannot serve as a rational explanation
for this development. To all appearances,
nothing else should result from the relation
between the patient and the analyst, than just
a certain measure of respect, confidence, gratitude
and humane sympathy. However, what
really results from it is this condition of attachment,
which in itself gives the impression
of being some disorder.</p>

<p class="c009">“Well, I should say that such a development
would tend to favor analytical purposes. If
one is enamoured, one is complacent and ready
to do almost anything for love’s sweet sake.”</p>

<p class="c009">Of course, in the beginning, this condition
favors the analysis, but later on, when these
sentimental relations gradually become intensified,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_133">133</span>displaying their inherent nature, difficulties
crop up which do not promote the aim
of the analysis. You see, an enamoured patient
is not satisfied merely to obey the analyst. The
patient becomes presumptuous, demanding
tenderness and sensual gratification. Eventually,
jealousy develops and the lovelorn patient
gradually arrives at a stage where more
and more clearly, a preparedness for enmity
and revenge is shown. Simultaneously, analogous
to any other form of love, all other impulses
of the soul are repressed, submerging
the interest in treatment and recuperation.
There is no doubt that love has assumed the
place of the neurosis, and that our labors have
simply resulted in substituting one disturbance
for another.</p>

<p class="c009">“That sounds hopeless. What can be done?
Perhaps analysis in such a case should be discarded.
But since you say that every case yields
this result, then analysis in general would have
to be discarded.”</p>

<p class="c009">First, let us take stock of the situation in order
to learn from it. Whatever is thus gained
may assist us in mastering the situation. After
<span class="pageno" id="Page_134">134</span>all, is it not quite remarkable that we should
succeed in transforming a neurotic condition
into a state of unwholesome attachment?</p>

<p class="c009">Our conviction that neurotic conditions
arise partly from abnormally directed sentimental
tendencies, gains unquestionable corroboration
by our findings. Ascertaining these
facts, we feel more assured and dare to make
this enamoured condition the object of analysis.</p>

<p class="c009">We also make another observation. This
condition of amorousness, as part of the analysis,
is not always so apparent in all cases, as I
have tried to picture it to you.</p>

<p class="c009">And why isn’t that the case? We shall soon
see.</p>

<p class="c009">In the same measure as the sensual and hostile
aspects of a patient’s attachment endeavor
to manifest themselves, the inherent opposition
of the patient against such tendencies asserts
itself. He combats them and attempts to
repress them, before our very eyes. Thus we
come to comprehend the whole development:—The
patient merely repeats, in the form of
being enamoured with the analyst, experiences
<span class="pageno" id="Page_135">135</span>of his soul life of days gone by. Certain tendencies
of his soul, ready to burst forth, and
closely connected with the inception of his
neurosis, have simply been transferred by him
to the analyst. He also repeats before our eyes
all those gestures of opposition, gone through
before, and would like nothing so much as to
repeat in his relations with the analyst, all the
phases of that forgotten period of his life.</p>

<p class="c009">What the patient is showing us now is accordingly
the very nucleus of the most intimate
story of his life. He is reproducing this
nucleus in a tangible form, as if actual, instead
of just remembering this incipient stage
of his condition. Thus, the riddle of transferred
love has been solved and the analysis,
with the assistance of this new discovery
which, for a time, almost seemed to wreck it,
may be continued.</p>

<p class="c009">“That is surely complicated. Does the patient
believe so easily that he is not in love,
and merely feels forced to revive an old episode,
as it were?”</p>

<p class="c009">Everything now depends upon the greatest
dexterity in handling this “transference,” to
<span class="pageno" id="Page_136">136</span>achieve our objective. You will easily see that
the demands of the analytical technique at
this point are very exacting. It is here where
the most serious mistakes may be committed,
or the most splendid results achieved. Any attempt
to evade these difficulties, by suppressing
or neglecting the transference, would be
senseless. Such evasion would not be deserving
of the term of analysis. To send a patient
home, as soon as the discomfort of a transference
neurosis manifests itself, would also be
senseless and would amount to cowardice. It
would be approximately analogous to calling
forth spirits and then running away, as soon as
they put in their appearance.</p>

<p class="c009">Of course, there is no other way out sometimes.
There are cases in which it is impossible
to master an unshackled transference, and the
analysis must then be terminated. But at least
one should wrestle with these evil spirits to
the best of one’s ability.</p>

<p class="c009">To give in to the demands of a transference—the
desires of a patient for tenderness or
sensual gratification—is impossible, not only
for moral reasons but also as it would prove
<span class="pageno" id="Page_137">137</span>impractical, if resorted to as a means to
achieve a successful analysis. A neurotic cannot
be healed, by being permitted to indulge in
uncorrected repetitions of situations which he
unconsciously prepared. When making a compromise
with a neurotic, by meeting him halfway,
it is necessary to take care not to be
manœuvred into the ludicrous position of the
clergyman, who tried to convert the insurance
agent with the result that the insurance agent
did not join the church, but the clergyman
took out a policy.</p>

<p class="c009">The only way out of the dilemma of transference
is to delve into the past of the patient
and reconstruct events as they were actually
lived through by the patient, or else only pictured,
with the assistance of his urge-stimulated
imagination. For all this, the analyst
requires much dexterity, patience, calmness
and self-effacement.</p>

<p class="c009">“And where, do you think, did the neurotic
meet the original of this transference love?”</p>

<p class="c009">In his childhood, and, as a rule, in one of
his parents. You will readily remember how
much importance we had to attach to these
<span class="pageno" id="Page_138">138</span>earliest of all sentimental relations. Here, the
circle is completed.</p>

<p class="c009">“You have finished, then? To be frank with
you, I am quite bewildered by all you have
told me. But, now pray tell me, where to study
all that is necessary to practise analysis?”</p>

<p class="c009">Two institutes serve this purpose by giving
instruction in psychoanalysis. The first is in
Berlin, in charge of Dr. Max Eitigon of the
local organization. The second is maintained
by the Vienna Psychoanalytical Society, with
great sacrifice. The authorities, up to now,
have thrown many obstacles in the path of the
young institute. A third institute will be
opened in London, by the local organization
there and will be under the direction of Dr.
E. Jones.</p>

<p class="c009">In all these institutes, the disciples themselves
are analysed, and are then given theoretical
instruction in all subjects important for
them. When permitted to analyse their first,
simple cases, they have the advantage of being
under the supervision of more experienced
analysts. The course usually requires about
two years, but even after this period, a disciple
<span class="pageno" id="Page_139">139</span>is still a beginner, and not by far to be considered
a master. What else the young analyst
needs, he acquires thorough practice, and by
intercourse with older colleagues.</p>

<p class="c009">The preparatory work for the analytical
training is not at all simple: the work is hard,
the responsibility tremendous.</p>

<p class="c009">Whoever attended such a course, has been
analysed himself, has grasped the Psychology
of the Unconscious, as far as it can be
taught today, is sufficiently versed in the
science of sex, and has acquired the difficult
technique of psychoanalysis, including the art
of interpretation, the method of combating
resistances and the manner in which to handle
transferences, can no longer be considered a
layman, in the field of psychoanalysis. He is
able to treat neurotic disturbances and will, in
time, be in a position to achieve all that may
be expected of this therapy.</p>

<div>
  <span class="pageno" id="Page_140">140</span>
  <h3 class="c001">VII</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-capa0_0_6 c008">“You have explained to me, at great
length, what psychoanalysis is, and
what knowledge is necessary to practise it with
a chance for success. It certainly could not
have hurt me to listen to you.</p>

<p class="c009">“However, I do not see how your informations
are expected to influence my personal
view. Neuroses, it would appear, are a certain
form of disturbance, and psychoanalysis a certain
method to treat such cases—a special medical
treatment, as it were.</p>

<p class="c009">“I understand that it is the rule that any
physician who intends to specialize in the one
phase or the other of his science is not satisfied
with the training he received before winning
his diploma, but rather goes on studying the
intricacies of his special field. This is especially
a necessity, in case he intends to establish
himself in a big city, the only place which
opens a satisfactory field for specialists. Anybody
<span class="pageno" id="Page_141">141</span>who is going to specialize in surgical
work, will practise, for a few years, in the
surgical ward. Corresponding specialized
work will be taken up by the eye or the nose
and throat specialist, and the psychiatrist may
forever remain on the staff of a city or county
institution or a private sanitarium.</p>

<p class="c009">“The same method of development may be
expected of the psychoanalyst. Whoever decides
to take up this new medical specialty,
after finishing his studies proper, will have to
attend those institutes, for the duration of two
years, which you have mentioned before, provided
it really takes as long as that to gain the
necessary knowledge. He will then also learn
that it would be to his advantage to join a psychoanalytical
society, in order to remain in
contact with his colleagues.</p>

<p class="c009">“I really cannot understand why there is
any necessity for raising this question of lay-analyses?”</p>

<p class="c009">Any physician, proceeding along the lines
you suggested, shall be welcome to us. As a
matter of fact, four-fifths of those whom I consider
my disciples, are physicians. However,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_142">142</span>permit me to enlighten you as to relations, as
they actually developed between physicians
and psychoanalysis, and what development
they appear to be taking in the future.</p>

<p class="c009">Past developments do not give physicians
any right to claim a monopoly of psychoanalysis.
As a matter of fact, physicians, in the past,
have done about everything to damage psychoanalysis,
beginning with superficial mockery
and going even so far as to indulge in serious
defamation. Of course, you may correctly
say that all this belongs to the past, and should
not have any influence on the future. I fully
agree, but I am afraid that the future will not
live up to your expectations.</p>

<p class="c009">At this point, permit me to interpret for you
the term of “quack,” not in the way it is legally
employed, but rather in the sense in which it
should be logically applied. As far as the law
is concerned, a “quack” is an individual who
treats sick people, without being in the possession
of a diploma. I, however, would rather
qualify the term “quack” in this way: A
“quack” is anybody who undertakes the treatment
<span class="pageno" id="Page_143">143</span>of a disease, without having the indispensable
knowledge and ability.</p>

<p class="c009">On the basis of this definition, I venture to
assert that—not only in the European countries—physicians,
as far as psychoanalysis is
concerned, constitute the majority of “quacks.”
Frequently, physicians will employ psychoanalysis,
without having studied it, and without
sufficiently understanding it.</p>

<p class="c009">Do not tell me that this would display a
lack of conscience, which you would not suspect
in any physician. You might be tempted
to say that, after all, a physician ought to
know that a medical diploma does not constitute
a “Letter of Marque,” and that a sick
person should not be considered outlawed. As
far as a physician is concerned, it should be
taken for granted that he is proceeding in good
faith, even if he makes a mistake.</p>

<p class="c009">However, facts are facts. Let us hope that it
will be possible to explain these facts in a
manner, which you apparently wish. I, for
my part, shall try to explain to you how it is
possible that a physician, in matters of psychoanalysis,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_144">144</span>takes liberties he would carefully
avoid in any other specialized field.</p>

<p class="c009">In the first place, it must be taken in consideration
that the training the medical student
received is almost the very opposite of
that which would be required of him, as a
preparation for psychoanalysis. His attention
has simply been focused upon facts which may
be objectively ascertained, such as present
themselves in anatomy, physics, and chemistry,
and which must be understood properly and
applied correctly, to achieve results.</p>

<p class="c009">As far as the psychological aspects of life
are concerned, no interest is created in the
medical student. The study of higher mental
achievements is not considered to belong within
the field of medicine, but rather into the
realm of another science. Psychiatry alone is
supposed to attend to disturbances of psychological
functions, and it is only too well known
in which way, and with what objective in view
this is done: psychiatry simply tries to discover
the physical reasons for psychological disturbances,
treating them in turn like any other ailment.</p>

<p class="c009"><span class="pageno" id="Page_145">145</span>Psychiatry is correct in that respect, and
medical training apparently excellent. Should
it be maintained that psychiatry is one-sided,
it will be necessary to fix the point of view
from which such a reproach may arise.</p>

<p class="c009">Inherently, all science is one-sided, and
must be one-sided, inasmuch as any science is
limited to certain subjects, points of view, and
methods. It is a nonsense which I do not wish
to support that one science may be played
against any other. Physics after all, does not
minimize the value of chemistry; it cannot replace
the latter nor be substituted for it. And,
surely, psychoanalysis is especially one-sided,
as the science of the psychological Unconscious.</p>

<p class="c009">Thus, the right to one-sidedness should not
be denied to medicine.</p>

<p class="c009">However, a more practical point of view is
gained if observations are not made as to scientific
medicine, but rather as to practical
healing. Sick people, presenting complicated
problems, should impress upon us the fact that
psychological manifestations—be they ever so
hard to comprehend—cannot be simply eliminated
<span class="pageno" id="Page_146">146</span>from the picture. The neurotic, more
than any other patient, presents an undesirable
complication. He offers a dilemma, not
less embarrassing to medicine than to law.
However, as long as such cases exist, they are
a responsibility especially of medicine. Nevertheless,
medical training, sorry to say, is not
paying sufficient attention to such conditions,—doing
nothing for them. Absolutely nothing
at all!</p>

<p class="c009">As there are very close inter-relations between
those things we consider physical and
those which we look upon as psychological, it
may be expected that the day will come when
organic biology and chemistry will finally approach
the understanding of neurotic manifestations.
This day, to be sure, seems to be in
the distant future. At present, such ailments
are still unapproachable, from a medical
angle.</p>

<p class="c009">If medical training would only deny information
to the student in the field of neurosis,
this would be tolerable. But medical training
is doing more. It implants into the young
student an incorrect and harmful point of
<span class="pageno" id="Page_147">147</span>view. Physicians, whose interest for psychological
facts has not been awakened, have
naturally a tendency of making little of such
facts, going even so far as to decry them as unscientific.
Conditions of neurotic character
are hardly ever taken seriously by them, while
their lack of knowledge serves to breed disrespect
for psychological research. Thus, neurosis
is not accorded sufficient attention.</p>

<p class="c009">Of course, these neurotics must be treated
when they consult physicians, and new discoveries
must be tried out right along. But why
go in for a protracted period of preparation?
It can be done without that! After all, who
knows whether there is really any value to
that which is taught in psychoanalytical institutes?</p>

<p class="c009">Thus, as usual, lack of information results
in a most daring spirit of enterprise. Only true
initiates are modest, because they realize how
insufficient their knowledge is!</p>

<p class="c009">From all this, it follows that it is impossible
to draw upon a comparison of psychoanalysis
with other branches of medicine, as you attempted
to do.</p>

<p class="c009"><span class="pageno" id="Page_148">148</span>As far as surgery, and ophthalmology, are
concerned, medical schools and post graduate
courses offer sufficient opportunities for training.
The psychoanalytical institutes are limited
in number, young in years, and lack the
aureola of authority. Medical science has not
recognized them, nor does it give a hoot about
them. On the other hand, the young physician
who has been forced to believe his teachers, to
such a degree, that he hardly ever had a
chance to form his own judgment, will only be
too glad to try his hand at playing the critic,
in a field where there is no established authority
as yet.</p>

<p class="c009">There are still other circumstances which
favor the mushroom-like increase of young
physicians as psychoanalytical “quacks.”</p>

<p class="c009">If a physician would undertake cataract
operations, without sufficient training as an
eye specialist, he would soon enough lose his
patients. Compared to this, the application
of psychoanalysis hardly involves any danger.
The public, generally observing effective cataract
operations, expects results from a physician
pretending to be an eye specialist. However,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_149">149</span>if a nerve specialist does not achieve
results, apparently nobody is surprised. We
surely have not been spoiled by the efficacy of
therapeutical treatment of nerve cases, and it
seems to suffice that the physician “tried everything.”
Nature must simply assert herself and
time exert its healing propensities.</p>

<p class="c009">If the patient happens to be a young girl, it
is first the menstruation which is expected to
work wonders, then marriage, and in later
years, change of life. In the end, death itself
may finally prove the great healer.</p>

<p class="c009">Moreover, whatever the medical analyst
employed in the treatment of such a case, is
so inconspicuous, as to offer no cause for reproach.
After all, he did not resort to instruments,
nor did he write prescriptions. He just
talked and talked, trying either to talk something
into the patient, or out of the patient.</p>

<p class="c009">How could such treatment do any damage,
especially as extreme care had been taken not
to touch upon painful or exciting matters?
The medical analyst, once he has thrown the
strict instructions overboard that were given to
him, will surely have tried to improve upon
<span class="pageno" id="Page_150">150</span>psychoanalysis by extracting from it certain
features—poisonous fangs, as it were—to
make analysis more acceptable to the patient.
How splendid, if he really went only as far as
that and not so far as to awaken resistances
which he would be unable to cope with. He
would be apt to make himself disliked in such
a case!</p>

<p class="c009">Justice demands that it be admitted that an
untrained analyst cannot do as much harm to
a patient, as an untrained surgeon. The possible
injury may amount to unnecessary expenditure
of money and time, and chances for
a cure may have either been destroyed, or else
spoilt to a certain degree. In addition to this,
the reputation of psychoanalytical therapy as
a whole would suffer. All this is quite undesirable,
but surely not as serious as the damage
that may arise from the knife of a surgical
“quack.” According to my observations, permanent
aggravation of an ailment is not to be
expected from the incorrect application of
psychoanalysis. Reactions of an undesirable
nature disappear quickly. In comparison to
the traumata inflicted by life itself, which resulted
<span class="pageno" id="Page_151">151</span>in the disturbances, a little incorrect
treatment does not amount to anything. The
unsuitable therapeutical attempt has simply
not benefited the patient.</p>

<p class="c009">“I have listened to your description of the
‘quack’ without interrupting you, and have
gained the impression that your position in
regard to physicians is barbed with hostility.
The reason for this enmity is obvious, from the
many hints you have dropped. At any rate, I
am of the opinion that as long as psychoanalysis
is to be employed, it should be only by such
persons as are thoroughly trained for it. But
it seems that you believe that even those physicians
who may take up psychoanalysis, in
the course of time, will not go in for the necessary
thorough training?”</p>

<p class="c009">Exactly! As long as the relation between the
medical schools and the psychological institutes
prevail as they do today, I do not think
that young physicians will resist the temptation
of making things easy for themselves.</p>

<p class="c009">“It appears to me that you constantly avoid
making any direct statement in regard to the
problem of lay-analyses. Apparently, what
<span class="pageno" id="Page_152">152</span>you wish me to surmise now is that it would be
your suggestion to withhold, as a means of revenge,
as an act of punishment, so to speak,
the monopoly of practising psychoanalysis
from physicians, because such physicians as
employ analysis, are beyond control. You
would, however, permit the application of
such medical activity to laymen.”</p>

<p class="c009">I am not so sure that you surmised my motives
correctly. Perhaps, I may later on be in
a position to prove to you that my point of
view is not as partial as all that. But be that
as it may, <em>I strongly emphasize my demand
that nobody should be permitted to practise
psychoanalysis, unless he has obtained this
privilege on the basis of thorough training</em>.
Whether such a person is a qualified physician
or not does not seem important to me.</p>

<p class="c009">“What, then, are your practical suggestions?”</p>

<p class="c009">I am not as far as that yet. I don’t even know
whether I shall ever get that far. There is
some other question which I wish to take up
with you, and by way of introduction, touch
upon a certain point.</p>

<p class="c009"><span class="pageno" id="Page_153">153</span>It is reported that the authorities, on the
strength of suggestions made by medical bodies,
may put a sweeping prohibition for the
practise of psychoanalysis by laymen on the
statute books. Such prohibition would naturally
also hit the non-medical members of psychoanalytical
societies—men and women who
have undergone a very thorough training and
improved themselves greatly by practice.
Should such a sweeping prohibition become
an actual fact, the incongruous condition
would then present itself whereby people
really capable of applying psychoanalysis
properly, would be excluded from this practice,
while on the other hand, this privilege
would be extended to individuals insufficiently
informed, and not specially trained for
such work.</p>

<p class="c009">Of course, no legislature aims at so absurd
an effect.</p>

<p class="c009">But the dilemma that presents itself with
this piece of legislature, is neither important
nor difficult. It would concern only a handful
of people who would not even suffer appreciably.
Analogous to measures enacted by
<span class="pageno" id="Page_154">154</span>monarchical Austria, republican Austria could
also resort to exception laws. Under the
Hapsburg régime, it happened that certain
“quacks” whose ability in the treatment of
certain diseases was convincing, were privileged
<em>ad personam</em> to treat sick people. These
were mostly cases of rustic healers, who enjoyed
the recommendation of one of those exalted,
once so plentiful, archduchesses. However,
it should be possible to assume that the
benefit of such exception laws should also pertain
to city inhabitants, who are recommended
by mere experts.</p>

<p class="c009">Of course, if the law is put on the statutes
in accordance with the wording of the bill
now pending, the Vienna Psychoanalytical Institute,
for example, would no longer be permitted
to accept students, unless they belonged
to the medical profession. All these endeavors
to restrict the application of psychoanalysis
hark back, more or less, to obsolete legislature,
dealing with quackery as such. This seems
anachronistic, inasmuch as at the time of the
enactment of these anti-quackery laws, the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_155">155</span>particular nature of neurotic disturbances had
not yet been discovered and psychoanalysis did
not yet exist.</p>

<p class="c009">I am now approaching the question which
appears most essential to me: Is the practice
of psychoanalysis of such a nature as to lend
itself to the interference of legislative authorities,
or would it not be much better to leave
psychoanalysis to its natural development?</p>

<p class="c009">Of course, I shall not decide this question,
but I am taking the liberty of submitting it
to you. It appears that in Austria, not unlike
other countries, by the way, there prevails a
real <em>furor prohibendi</em>, a veritable mania for
prohibition and general interference, a trend
which usually, as is only too well known,
makes for unsatisfactory results. According
to my own personal view, a superabundance of
ordinances and prohibitions will only serve to
injure the dignity of the law. It may usually
be observed that wherever there are just a
few laws, these laws are strictly adhered to,
whereas where laws exist in great numbers,
the temptation arises to break them.</p>

<p class="c009"><span class="pageno" id="Page_156">156</span>Furthermore, a man cannot be considered
an anarchist, simply because he believes that
legislative statutes—in the view of their very
origin—cannot very well be regarded as something
holy that must never be touched. Legislative
measures sometimes are insufficient, or
gradually become that, at the same time outraging
our innate sense for justice and common
sense. Then the time is on hand, where
there is no other means of correcting such
unbearable conditions than to simply trespass
against such laws. It seems advisable, for the
purpose of maintaining respect for laws and
ordinances, not to enact any which may be
difficult to enforce.</p>

<p class="c009">Much of what has been said here about the
application of psychoanalysis by physicians
would have to be repeated with regard to
lay-analyses proper, which the legislatures of
some countries are now prepared to prohibit.
In view of the fact that the application of the
analysis is a very simple procedure, consisting
merely of conversation without resorting
to instruments or prescriptions, it would be
rather difficult to prove that a layman actually
<span class="pageno" id="Page_157">157</span>employed psychoanalysis, if he stoutly
maintained that he had merely benefited a
person by administering a good “talking to.”
Such assistance, to a person in need of it,
could not very well be prohibited simply because
a physician may once in a while resort
to the identical thing!</p>

<p class="c009">In English speaking countries, Christian
Science has gained tremendous popularity. To
my mind, it constitutes a dialectic abnegation
of such evils as life presents, by resorting to
the teaching of Christian religion. I do not
hesitate to state that such measures strike me
as a regrettable fallacy of the human mind.
But who in the United States or England
would ever think of prohibiting Christian
Science or seek to punish its followers?</p>

<p class="c009">Generally speaking, is governmental authority
always so certain to be on the right
side? Assumed even that many, left to their
own devices, would encounter danger and experience
harm, would it not just the same be
much better if governmental authority would
merely indicate dangerous ground, but on
the whole leave it to the individual to be
<span class="pageno" id="Page_158">158</span>taught by experience and mutual influence?</p>

<p class="c009">Psychoanalysis is so new, the broad masses
so insufficiently informed about it, the official
view of science still so vacillating, that it
appears to me as premature to impede its
progress by legislative measures.</p>

<p class="c009">Why not leave it to the patients themselves
to learn that it is dangerous for them to apply
for psychological assistance to persons who
are not sufficiently informed?</p>

<p class="c009">If people are sufficiently enlightened and
warned, prohibition will surely prove superfluous.</p>

<p class="c009">On Italian highways, poles, carrying high
tension electric power, display this warning:
“<i><span lang="it">Chi tocca, muore!</span></i>” Which has proven perfectly
sufficient. In contrast to this, in other
countries, for example Austria and Germany,
this warning is of an insulting verbosity:—
“Inasmuch as touching these high tension
wires is dangerous to life, it is herewith
strictly prohibited to meddle with them!”
Why this prohibition? Whoever cherishes his
life will not touch them, and whoever wants
<span class="pageno" id="Page_159">159</span>to commit suicide will surely not be detained
by the warning.</p>

<p class="c009">“But there are cases which may be quoted
as precedent for the prohibition of lay-analyses.
For example, the law against the practice
of hypnosis by laymen, and another enacted
against occult séances and the organization of
spiritualistic societies.”<a id="r1"></a><a class="c014 pginternal" href="#f1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

<p class="c009">I must admit that it is beyond me to admire
these measures. As far as the last mentioned
prohibition is concerned, it surely constitutes
a case of grave over-officiousness, encroaching
upon intellectual freedom. As far as I am
personally concerned, I do not think that anybody
would suspect me of having faith in occult
phenomena, or of being interested in its
general acceptance. However, such prohibitive
measures will never serve to stifle the interest
that some people manifest for the alleged
secrets of an occult world. Such officious
interference may do a lot of damage by
preventing impartial seekers for truth to arrive
at a finding which would do away with
<span class="pageno" id="Page_160">160</span>occult misconceptions. Here also, we observe
the fact that other countries do not interfere
with so-called “parapsychic” research, but
only Austria.</p>

<p class="c009">As far as hypnosis is concerned, it is somewhat
different from analysis. Hypnosis is
nothing else but induction of an abnormal
condition of the soul, serving the layman
merely as a means of entertainment. Had hypnotic
therapy fulfilled its early promise, conditions
would have evolved similar to those
now prevailing in psychoanalysis.</p>

<p class="c009">Aside from this, the history of hypnosis contributes
another precedent for the fate of psychoanalysis.
When I was still a young instructor
of neuropathology, physicians fervently
fought against hypnosis, claiming it to be
nothing but a fake, an infernal delusion, a
most dangerous practice. Today, this same
hypnosis has been monopolized by them. They
are resorting to it as a method of examination.
For some nerve specialists, hypnosis is their
most important stock in trade.</p>

<p class="c009">However, I have already told you that I
<span class="pageno" id="Page_161">161</span>do not intend to discuss whether restriction by
law or a hands-off policy would be the most
correct procedure, concerning psychoanalysis.
I know very well that this is a question
of principle which will be decided by the
inclination of influential people rather than
by strict argumentation. What seems to me to
suggest a policy of <em>laissez faire</em> I have already
mentioned. But if the decision should be one
for active interference, then, to be sure, it
would appear to me as a one-sided and unjust
measure to enact a sweeping prohibition
against the practice of psychoanalysis by laymen.
Then, it would be up to the legislature
to fix the conditions under which the application
of psychoanalysis would be permissible
for those who would be privileged to employ
it. It would also be necessary to appoint an
authority who could be appealed to for information,
who would decide what constitutes
psychoanalysis, what the training would be,
and how to administer it.</p>

<p class="c009">Thus, things must either be left alone or
else order must be created and the situation,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_162">162</span>in general, clarified. But there is no use in
simply interfering with a complicated situation,
by means of a prohibition, which is
based without much discretion, upon obsolete
acts of an antiquated legislature.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-capa0_0_6 c008">“But the physicians! It seems I am really
unable to bring you to the main point
of our conversation. You are continually evading
me. After all, the question before us is
whether physicians should be given the exclusive
right to employ psychoanalysis, that is,
after they have fulfilled certain conditions, if
you should insist upon such. According to
your own statement, the majority of ‘quacks,’
dabbling with psychoanalysis, does not consist
of physicians. You also admit that the
greatest number of your disciples and followers
are physicians. I have heard that these do
not share your point of view, in regard to lay-analyses.</p>

<p class="c009">“Of course, it is to be expected that your
disciples agree with you in the question of
sufficient training. Just the same, they hold
the laymen should be excluded from the
practice of psychoanalysis. Is that really the
case? And if so, how do you account for it?”</p>

<p class="c009"><span class="pageno" id="Page_164">164</span>You are correctly informed. Not all, but a
great number of my medically trained collaborators
do not side with me in this matter,
but insist that psychoanalytical treatment of
neurotics be exclusively reserved for physicians.
From this, you may gather that even
within the limits of our own camps, there prevails
a difference of opinion. Although my
point of view is very well known, the divergence
of opinion in matters of lay-analyses, in
no way interferes with an otherwise splendid
harmony.</p>

<p class="c009">How to explain this position of some of
my disciples?</p>

<p class="c009">I am not so sure, but I assume that professional
pride is behind it. You see, their process
of development has been different from mine.
That they find themselves somewhat isolated
from their colleagues, is still annoying them.
They would like to be considered, by the profession
as a whole, as members in good standing,
so to say. Thus, in order to win the tolerance
of their Æsculapian brothers, they are
willing to make a sacrifice, whose value is
apparently not clear to them.</p>

<p class="c009"><span class="pageno" id="Page_165">165</span>Of course, I may be wrong here. To assume
that fear of competition is dictating their position,
would not only amount to suspecting
them of a low motive, but also condemn them
for a peculiar shortsightedness. After all, as
long as they are ready to initiate colleagues
into psychoanalysis, it can be of no importance
to them whether they will have to share prospective
patients with them, or with laymen.</p>

<p class="c009">Probably, there is something else to be considered.
They may be impressed by certain
features which, in the practice of psychoanalysis
assure the physician of an unquestionable
advantage over the layman.</p>

<p class="c009">“There you are:—‘Assure the advantage’!
At last, you admit this advantage! I should
think this admission settles our argument.”</p>

<p class="c009">I admit this advantage. Perhaps by doing
so I shall prove to you that I am not as passionately
deluded as you think. I postponed
mentioning these conditions, because in airing
them, additional theoretical discussion is
necessary.</p>

<p class="c009">“What are you driving at now?”</p>

<p class="c009">There is first the question of diagnosis. Before
<span class="pageno" id="Page_166">166</span>admitting a patient, suffering from nervous
disturbances, to psychoanalytical treatment,
one naturally desires to have as much
assurance as possible that this therapy is suitable
in that particular case, that is, that the
patient has a good chance of being benefited
by psychoanalysis. This can only be the case,
if he is actually suffering from neurosis.</p>

<p class="c009">“I should think that would be easily ascertained,
by the symptoms he complains
about.”</p>

<p class="c009">You are putting your finger just on the
point, where new complications may arise. It
is not always possible to be perfectly sure of
such a case. The patient, in spite of displaying
all the visible symptoms of neurosis, may actually
be suffering from something else. The
incipient stage of a mental disease, for example,
or the beginning of a process destroying
his brain. To distinguish between such symptoms
is not always easy or possible. Responsibility
for such a decision must naturally be
assumed by the physician alone. And as mentioned
before, it is not so easy for him. For
the longest time, an ailment may appear absolutely
<span class="pageno" id="Page_167">167</span>harmless, until finally manifesting its
malignant character. Nervous people, as a
rule, fear that they may be on the road to
some mental disease.</p>

<p class="c009">Assumed that a physician has not correctly
diagnosed a case, or has been unable to discover
its true nature, nothing has been lost, no
damage has been done. Analytical treatment,
although not doing any harm to the patient,
would have been superfluous in such a case.
It might have given any number of people
a chance to lay the blame for the unfortunate
development of the case at the door of psychoanalysis.
Unjustly so, to be sure, but such a
likelihood should be avoided nevertheless.</p>

<p class="c009">“That sounds hopeless. It apparently tears
out, by the very roots, everything you told
me about the nature and development of a
neurosis.”</p>

<p class="c009">Not at all. It only strengthens the fact that
neurotics are a nuisance and a dilemma for
all parties concerned, including the psychoanalysts.
I may be able to alleviate your new
apprehensions if I make myself clearer. Probably
it would be more correct to say of such
<span class="pageno" id="Page_168">168</span>cases, as we now have under discussion, that
they actually present neuroses. However, these
neuroses are not psychic but rather somatic,
that is, they do not originate from the soul,
but rather from the body. Do you understand
me?</p>

<p class="c009">“I do. But I am at a loss to connect all this
with the psychological aspect.”</p>

<p class="c009">That can easily be done, if only complications
of the living substance are sufficiently
taken into consideration. What was the inherent
feature of a neurosis? That the “I,”
constituting the very essence of the soul, so to
speak, developed and improved by the influence
of the outer world, proved unable to
fulfill its mediating functions between the
“It” and reality; that the “I,” on account of
its weakness, shirked its duties in regard to the
“It,” thus incurring repressions from which
it suffers. It is because such weakness of the
“I” regularly takes place in all of us in childhood
that events of our tender years exert
such great importance in later life.</p>

<p class="c009">In the few years of our childhood, we have
to cover the enormous distance of development
<span class="pageno" id="Page_169">169</span>from primitive man of the Stone Age to
civilized man of today. In addition to this
tremendous burden, the child has to ward off
the urges of an early sexuality. Small wonder,
then, that our “I” takes recourse to repressions,
thus exposing itself to childhood neuroses,
the effects of which in turn furnish the
disposition for nervous disturbances in more
mature years.</p>

<p class="c009">Everything now depends upon how the
growing up individual will be treated by fate.
If life is too hard, the divergence between
urges and the opposition of reality too great,
the “I” may remain unsuccessful in its endeavors
to mediate between the two. This is
the more probable, the more the “I” is encroached
upon by such infantile dispositions
as it may have acquired in tender years. Thus,
the process of repression is repeated; urges
tear themselves free from the sovereignty of
the “I” to gain, by way of regression, a substitute
for the gratification they crave, while
the poor “I” has become helplessly neurotic.</p>

<p class="c009">Let us hold on firmly to this: that the most
important, the pivotal point in the whole situation,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_170">170</span>so to speak, is the relative strength of
the “I” in all its phases. It is easy, then, to
complete our whole etiological survey, that is
our endeavor to assign causes to the phenomena
observed. We already know the normal
causes for nervousness to be the infantile weakness
of the “I,” the checking of early sexual
urges, and the influence of chance episodes in
our childhood.</p>

<p class="c009">But is there no possibility that there are also
some other contributory factors, antedating
childhood? For example, an inborn strength
and unruliness of those urges which constitute
the “It,” presenting right from the very start
a task much too difficult for the “I”? Or could
a certain weakness, existing for reasons unknown,
in the development of the “I” be held
responsible? Of course, all these possibilities
will exert an etiological importance, in some
cases of surpassing value.</p>

<p class="c009">The specific driving power of the “It” must
always be taken into consideration, and wherever
it is developed to an excessive degree,
there are only meagre chances for a successful
application of our therapy. Of the reasons
<span class="pageno" id="Page_171">171</span>that block the development of the “I,” we
still know too little to account for such cases
of neurosis which arise on a constitutional
basis. It may be assumed that neurosis hardly
ever develops unless there are constitutional
or congenital factors increasing the possibility
for such a condition. However, if it is correct
that the relative weakness of the “I” is the
deciding factor for the development of neuroses,
then it would also appear possible that
later, physical disturbances may result in a
neurosis provided it also results in a weakening
of the “I.”</p>

<p class="c009">This happens only too frequently. Such a
physical disturbance may aim at the “It,” intensifying
its urges to an extent where the “I”
is not able to cope with them any more. As an
example for such developments, the changes
induced in woman by the disturbances of menstruation
and menopause could perhaps be
drawn upon. Other reasons that may weaken
the “I” are general physical disturbances, organic
diseases of the central nervous system.
All of these may result in interference with
those sources from which the soul apparatus
<span class="pageno" id="Page_172">172</span>draws its strength, to lead, in turn, to an encroachment
of its more delicate functions,
which are necessary to maintain unimpaired
the whole “I” organization. In all these cases,
neurosis presents about the same picture.
However, while manifesting the same psychological
mechanism, neuroses develop on
the basis of a multifarious, frequently highly
complicated etiology; that is, they arise from
a great number of various causes.</p>

<p class="c009">“That suits me better. At last you have
spoken like a physician. And now I am waiting
for you to admit that so complicated a
condition as a neurosis should only be treated
by a physician.”</p>

<p class="c009">I am afraid you are expecting too much.
What we have just discussed belonged in the
realm of pathology. Psychoanalysis, however,
is a therapeutical process. I admit, no, I even
insist, that a physician should first diagnose
each and every case where psychoanalysis
seems applicable. Fortunately, the greater
number of neuroses are of a psychical nature
and not pathologically induced. As soon as the
physician has ascertained this, he may safely
<span class="pageno" id="Page_173">173</span>leave the treatment to the lay-analyst. We
have always followed this procedure within
our analytical societies. Thanks to this close
coöperation between the medically trained
and non-trained members, errors almost never
occur.</p>

<p class="c009">There is another emergency when the analyst
has to invite the assistance of a physician.
It is possible that, in the course of psychoanalytical
treatment, symptoms—mostly of physical
nature—appear which may either be part
of the neurosis, or else manifestations of independent,
organic disturbances. Here, the decision
must once more be left to the physician.</p>

<p class="c009">“From all this, there follows that the analysts,
even during the analysis, cannot dispense
with the physician. This is another argument
against lay-analyses.”</p>

<p class="c009">No, this possibility cannot be drawn upon as
an argument against lay-analyses, because in
an analogous case the medically trained analyst
would not proceed any differently.</p>

<p class="c009">“I do not understand that.”</p>

<p class="c009">There is a rule that even a medically trained
analyst, running across such dubious symptoms
<span class="pageno" id="Page_174">174</span>in the course of the treatment, is not to
depend on his own judgment, but to consult
some colleague, preferably a specialist of internal
diseases.</p>

<p class="c009">“Why this rule, apparently so superfluous?”</p>

<p class="c009">This rule is not superfluous at all. There are
several reasons for it. In the first place, it is
hard to combine organic and psychical treatment.
In the second place, the particular condition
of transference frequently prevailing in
analyses may make it inadvisable for the analyst
to subject his patient to physical examination.
In the third place, there are all the reasons
in the world for the analyst to doubt his
own opinion, inasmuch as he is so intensely interested
in the psychical aspects of the case.</p>

<p class="c009">“I now understand your position towards
lay-analyses. You insist that there must be lay-analysts.
However, as you have to admit their
insufficiency for the task, you compile everything
that could serve to excuse them, and
make things in general easier for them. To be
frank with you, I cannot understand why we
should have lay-analysts at all, inasmuch as
they would never be more than second-class
<span class="pageno" id="Page_175">175</span>therapeutists. This need not include those few
laymen who have already received their training,
but institutes for psychological training
should not accept laymen any more.”</p>

<p class="c009">I would assent to all this, if I could be
shown that such restrictions would benefit all
parties interested. You will admit that these
interests are tri-fold:—There is the interest of
the patient, the interest of the physicians, and
last but not least, the interest of science which,
in turn, includes the interest of all patients of
the future. Let us investigate these three
points.</p>

<p class="c009">It does not matter whether the patient be
analysed by a physician or a layman, as long
as any danger of mistaking his condition is excluded
by being properly examined by a physician
before the beginning of the treatment,
or re-examined as soon as developments, in the
course of the analysis, make this advisable. It
is much more important for the patient that
the analyst possesses those personal qualities
which invite full confidence, and that he has
that knowledge and experience which alone
qualify him to apply psychoanalysis. To some
<span class="pageno" id="Page_176">176</span>people, it may seem that it might undermine
the authority of the analyst to have his patient
know that he is no physician and must obtain
the advice of a medically trained expert in
certain matters. However, although we have
never kept a patient in the dark, as to the qualifications
of an analyst, we have come to the
conclusion that the patients have no prejudice
against a non-medically trained analyst; they
are only too glad to accept the benefits of treatment,
wherever they offer themselves—a fact
resented by the medical profession for the
longest time.</p>

<p class="c009">It also must be considered that analysts,
practising today, are men and women with
academic training and degrees, pedagogues,
of great experience and impressive personality.
The analysis, to which all candidates of
psychoanalytical institutes are required to submit,
is the best means of testing their personal
suitability for the performance of so exerting
an activity as an analysis presents.</p>

<p class="c009">In reference to the interest of the physicians,
I do not believe that medicine has anything to
gain by annexing psychoanalysis. Today, medical
<span class="pageno" id="Page_177">177</span>training requires five years, with almost
a whole sixth year taken up with examinations.
Ever so often, new demands in regard to
training are made with which the young student
must comply, if his medical education is
to be considered adequate. Generally speaking,
while it is difficult today to enter the medical
profession, the practice of medicine is neither
very satisfactory nor very advantageous. And
as soon as the undoubtedly justified necessity
is realized that the physician be also informed
of the psychological aspects of diseases, thus
including in medical training a partial preparation
for psychoanalysis, there would follow
an extension of the medical curriculum
and a corresponding extension of the period of
training. I do not know how physicians would
like such a development, arising from the
monopoly they claim on psychoanalysis. But
these demands would then have to be fulfilled
and at a time when, in general, the material
aspects of those strata of society which contribute
the greatest contingent to the medical
profession, are such that young physicians
must establish a practice, as soon as possible.</p>

<p class="c009"><span class="pageno" id="Page_178">178</span>However, the medical profession may not
intend to include preparation for psychoanalysis
into the medical curriculum proper. The
general opinion may be that it is much more
practical for the young physician to acquire
psychoanalytical knowledge only after having
completed his medical education. It may be
said that such a procedure would not involve
any actual loss of time, inasmuch as a young
man under thirty never gains that confidence
of patients which is an indispensable condition
for benefiting a patient psychoanalytically.
Of course, it could be said that a young physician,
too, who has just won his diploma, cannot
command too much respect, as regards his
opinion of the physical ailments of his patients,
and that the young analyst could very
well utilize his time, by working in a psychological
clinic, under the supervision of an experienced
practitioner.</p>

<p class="c009">It seems to me that the aforementioned demand
amounts to a waste of energy which, in
view of economic conditions, does not seem
justified. Although analytical training invades
the field of medical training, it neither includes
<span class="pageno" id="Page_179">179</span>this training, nor is included by it. If a
psychoanalytical college were to be organized,
which today may strike one as being a fantastic
idea, the curriculum of this institution
would have to include much of what is taught
in medical schools. Aside from the Psychology
of the Depths, which would naturally always
be the main subject taught, Biology would
have to be included in the course, and Science
of Sex would also be one of the major subjects.
In addition, adequate instruction would have
to be given on such disturbances which belong
in the realm of Psychiatry. Psychoanalytical
training would have to include a number of
subjects which have no connection with medicine,
and never enter the physician’s practice,
such as History of Civilization, Mythology,
Psychology of Religion, and Literature.
Without being well acquainted with these subjects,
the analyst will be unable to grasp the
problems that will face him in the course of
his practice.</p>

<p class="c009">Most of the subjects, however, belonging
to medical training, will not be of any use to
him and although all this knowledge is highly
<span class="pageno" id="Page_180">180</span>valuable for those who need it, it would not
assist the analyst to understand a neurotic condition
nor to alleviate it. In case the objection
is made here that specialists in other fields of
medical endeavor, also do not need all the details
they acquire in the course of their training,
it must be said that such a case could not
be considered analogous. For many branches
of medicine, such facts as, for example, Pathology
presents, are of great importance. The
analyst, however, reaches out for a variety of
experiences, with different phenomena, underlying
different laws. Although philosophy
may succeed in bridging the chasm between
body and soul, as far as our own experience
is concerned, this chasm, nevertheless, exists,
presenting itself in an especially striking light,
as regards our practical endeavors.</p>

<p class="c009">It seems unjust and impractical to force a
person to take a roundabout route via medical
training, if this person be bent upon relieving
another individual from the agonies of a phobia
or a fixed idea. Moreover, such a procedure
would be ineffective, as long as psychoanalysis
in general is not suppressed.</p>

<p class="c009"><span class="pageno" id="Page_181">181</span>Just imagine that somewhere in the country,
there is a certain mountain top that can be
reached by two different roads, the one being
short and straight, and the other long and
winding. An attempt is made to block the
short road by a “no-trespass” sign. There is
some chance of this sign being respected, if the
short road is steep and difficult to climb,
whereas the long road is easy to travel. However,
if the detour should be the more difficult
road, you can easily surmise how little the
trespassing sign would be respected.</p>

<p class="c009">I am very much afraid it will be just as
difficult to force the laymen to study medicine,
as it is for me to induce physicians to
study psychoanalysis. Human nature is like
that.</p>

<p class="c009">“If you are correct in your assumption that
analytical treatment cannot be administered
without a special training, but that on the
other hand the medical curriculum could not
bear the burden of psychoanalytical training,
and that medical knowledge, to the greatest
extent, is superfluous for the analyst, how will
we ever achieve the ideal medical personality,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_182">182</span>the physician who can cope with all the demands
of his profession?”</p>

<p class="c009">I am unable to foresee how to solve these
difficulties, and I do not feel called upon to
make any suggestions. I only perceive two
things clearly: firstly, that the analysis seems
to constitute a dilemma, but certainly the neurotic
is also a dilemma; secondly, that for
the time being, all interests would be served
if physicians resolve to tolerate a class of therapeutists
who will relieve them of the arduous
treatment of those tremendously frequent psychical
neuroses, in addition benefiting the patients
by remaining in constant contact with
them.</p>

<p class="c009">“Is that your last word in reference to the
problem of lay-analyses, or is there something
else?”</p>

<p class="c009">There is a third interest to be considered:—that
of science. Although what I have to say
in that respect may not mean much to you, it
nevertheless means a good deal to me.</p>

<p class="c009">We do not consider it advisable that psychoanalysis
be swallowed up by medicine,
finally to be shelved in a text-book of psychiatry,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_183">183</span>under the chapter heading of Therapy,
together with such other treatments as Hypnotic
Suggestion, Auto Suggestion, Persuasion
which, due to lack of knowledge, were indebted
for their short lives to the indolence
and ignorance of the broad masses. Psychoanalysis
deserves a better fate, which, let us
hope, it will really attain.</p>

<p class="c009">As the Psychology of the Depths, the teaching
of the Unconscious, psychoanalysis may
prove indispensable to all sciences which deal
with the development of human culture, and
such of its great achievements as art, religion,
and civilized society. Psychoanalysis has already
appreciably assisted these sciences in
the solution of their problems. But all this
is insignificant, compared to what may be
achieved through psychoanalysis in the future,
when students of History, Psychology of Religion,
and Etymology, will avail themselves
to the fullest extent of the assistance psychoanalysis
will be able to render them.</p>

<p class="c009">The employment of psychoanalysis for the
treatment of neuroses is only one of its possibilities,
and time may yet prove that this is
<span class="pageno" id="Page_184">184</span>not even the most important of them. At any
rate, it would be unfair to sacrifice all other
advantages of psychoanalysis, simply because
there is just one phase where the application
of psychoanalysis encroaches upon the preserves
of medicine.</p>

<p class="c009">Here another aspect manifests itself which
cannot be interfered with, without causing
damage. If the representatives of the different
sciences should really take up the study of
psychoanalysis, to apply it in their own spheres
of interest, it would not suffice for them to
merely avail themselves of such results as have
been recorded in psychoanalytical literature.
They will have to come to an understanding of
psychoanalysis in the only way possible, that
is, by submitting themselves to analysis.</p>

<p class="c009">Thus, to the neurotics in need of analysis, a
second class of persons would be added: those
who undergo analysis for intellectual reasons
and who would welcome that intensification of
their efficiency which would result incidentally
from analysis. To undertake these analyses,
a number of analysts would be necessary
for whom medical knowledge would be of
<span class="pageno" id="Page_185">185</span>specially limited importance. However, these
instructor-analysts—as they ought to be called—are
in need of an especially thorough training,
which they can only obtain if they are
given opportunities to study interesting and
convincing cases. Inasmuch as healthy persons
do not feel the necessity and curiosity to be analysed,
neurotics would have to be the objects
of study for the instructor-analysts. Their
study would be guided by expert analysts, with
a special eye to their future, non-medical
work. Of course, all this necessitates a certain
amount of freedom of action, and would not
brook petty interference.</p>

<p class="c009">Perhaps you do not believe in these strictly
theoretical endeavors of psychoanalysis, and
are not ready to admit their importance, in
connection with the practical side of the
problem of lay-analyses. In that case, let me
remind you that there is another field for the
application of psychoanalysis, outside the
hunting ground of the “quack”—a field which
physicians will hardly claim as their own.
I allude to the application of psychoanalysis to
pedagogy.</p>

<p class="c009"><span class="pageno" id="Page_186">186</span>As soon as a child manifests the first signs of
an undesirable development, by being moody,
stubborn and inattentive, neither the child specialist
nor the school physician will be able
to do anything for him; not even when a
child shows such clear signs of nervous disturbances
as timidity, lack of appetite, vomiting,
and sleeplessness. A treatment which combines
analytical influence with pedagogic measures
and is applied by persons who are not
above delving into the child’s own world and
who understand how to penetrate the soul life
of the child, will succeed not only in dissolving
nervous disturbances, but also in reversing
incipient traits of character.</p>

<p class="c009">The importance which we were forced to
attach to apparently unimportant neurotic
conditions of children, in view of the fact that
they very often serve as a disposition for disturbances
in later life, would prove that the
analyses of children constitute a splendid
means of prophylaxis. Although psychoanalysis
still has its enemies, I do not know what
means are at their disposal to hinder the activity
of a pedagogic analyst, or analytical
<span class="pageno" id="Page_187">187</span>pedagogue, and I doubt whether this could be
done so easily.</p>

<p class="c009">To return once more to the problem of the
analytical treatment of adults, suffering from
nervous disturbances, we have not yet exhausted
all points of view. Civilized life of
today exerts an almost unbearable pressure,
which necessitates corrective measures. Does
it seem too fantastic to expect that psychoanalysis,
in spite of the many difficulties it encounters,
should be called upon to furnish this
corrective agent? Maybe some American millionaire
will one day donate enough money
for the psychoanalytical training of the social
workers of his country, thus creating an
emergency corps, to fight neurotic conditions
brought about by present-day life.</p>

<p class="c009">“You mean some sort of a new Salvation
Army?”</p>

<p class="c009">Why not? After all, our fancy always follows
existing patterns. The stream of eager
students that will then flood towards Europe,
will, of course, have to pass Vienna, because
there the development of psychoanalysis may
have prematurely died, on account of governmental
<span class="pageno" id="Page_188">188</span>interference. You smile? I’m not
saying this to sway your judgment. I know you
don’t believe me, and I surely cannot guarantee
that my predictions will come true. But
there is one thing I know: it is not at all important
what the opinions of individuals and
of individual governments may be, in respect
to the problem of lay-analyses. All this can
only have limited effects. What is really important
is that potentialities for the development
of psychoanalysis cannot be affected by
ordinances and prohibitions.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-capa0_0_6 c008">Several of the contributors to this series
of “Autobiographical Studies”<a id="r2"></a><a class="c014 pginternal" href="#f2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> have begun
by expressing their misgivings at the unusual
difficulties of the task they have undertaken.
The difficulties in my case are, I think,
even greater; for I have already more than
once published papers upon the same lines as
the present one, papers which, from the nature
of the subject, have dealt more with personal
considerations than is usual or than
would otherwise have been necessary.</p>

<p class="c009">I gave my first account of the development
and subject-matter of psychoanalysis in five
lectures which I delivered in 1909 before
Clark University at Worcester, Mass., where
I had been invited to attend the celebration of
the twentieth anniversary of the foundation of
<span class="pageno" id="Page_192">192</span>that body.<a id="r3"></a><a class="c014 pginternal" href="#f3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> Only recently I gave way to the
temptation of making a contribution of a similar
kind to an American collective publication
dealing with the opening years of the
twentieth century, since its editors had shown
their recognition of the importance of psychoanalysis
by allotting a special chapter to it.<a id="r4"></a><a class="c014 pginternal" href="#f4"><sup>[4]</sup></a>
Between these two dates appeared a paper,
“On the History of the Psycho-Analytic
Movement,”<a id="r5"></a><a class="c014 pginternal" href="#f5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> which, in fact, contains the
essence of all that I can say on the present occasion.
Since I must not contradict myself and
since I have no wish to repeat myself exactly,
I must endeavor to construct a narrative in
which subjective and objective attitudes, biographical
and historical interests, are combined
in a new proportion.</p>

<p class="c009">I was born on May 6th, 1856, at Freiberg in
Moravia, a small town in what is now Czecho-Slovakia.
<span class="pageno" id="Page_193">193</span>My parents were Jews, and I have
remained a Jew myself. I have reason to believe
that my father’s family were settled for
a long time on the Rhine (at Cologne), that,
as a result of a persecution of the Jews during
the fourteenth or fifteenth century, they fled
eastwards, and that, in the course of the nineteenth
century, they migrated back from Lithuania
through Galicia into German Austria.
When I was a child of four I came to Vienna,
and I went through the whole of my education
there. At the Gymnasium I was at the top
of my class for seven years; I enjoyed special
privileges there, and was scarcely obliged to
pass any examinations. Although we lived in
very limited circumstances, my father insisted
that, in my choice of a profession, I should
follow my own inclinations. Neither at that
time, nor indeed in my later life, did I feel
any particular predilection for the career of
a physician. I was moved, rather, by a sort of
curiosity, which was, however, directed more
towards human concerns than towards natural
objects; nor had I recognized the importance
of observation as one of the best means of
<span class="pageno" id="Page_194">194</span>gratifying it. At the same time, the theories of
Darwin, which were then of topical interest,
strongly attracted me, for they held out hopes
of an extraordinary advance in our understanding
of the world; and it was hearing
Goethe’s beautiful essay on Nature read aloud
at a popular lecture just before I left school
that decided me to become a medical student.</p>

<p class="c009">When, in 1873, I first joined the University,
I was met by some appreciable disappointments.
Above all, I found that I was expected
to feel myself inferior and an alien, because I
was a Jew. I refused absolutely to do the first
of these things. I have never been able to see
why I should feel ashamed of my descent or,
as people were beginning to say, of my race.
I put up, without much regret, with my nonadmission
to the community; for it seemed to
me that in spite of this exclusion an active
fellow-worker could not fail to find some
nook or cranny in the frame-work of humanity.
These first impressions at the University,
however, had one consequence which was afterwards
to prove important; for at an early
age I was made familiar with the fate of being
<span class="pageno" id="Page_195">195</span>in the Opposition and of being put under the
ban of the “compact majority.” The foundations
were thus laid for a certain degree of independence
of judgment.</p>

<p class="c009">I was compelled, moreover, during my
first years at the University, to make the discovery
that the peculiarities and limitations
of my gifts denied me all success in many of
the departments of science into which my
youthful eagerness had plunged me. Thus I
learned the truth of Mephistopheles’ warning:</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c013">

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c009">At length, in Ernst Brücke’s physiological
laboratory, I found rest and satisfaction—and
men, too, whom I could respect and take as
my models. Brücke gave me a problem to
work out in the histology of the nervous system;
I succeeded in solving it to his satisfaction
and in carrying the work further on my
own account. I worked at this Institute, with
<span class="pageno" id="Page_196">196</span>short interruptions, from 1876 to 1882, and it
was generally thought that I was marked out
to fill the next post of Assistant that might fall
vacant there. The various branches of medicine
proper, apart from psychiatry, had no
attraction for me. I was decidedly negligent
in pursuing my medical studies, and it was
not until 1881 that I took my somewhat belated
degree as a Doctor of Medicine.</p>

<p class="c009">The turning point came in 1882, when my
teacher, for whom I felt the highest possible
esteem, corrected my father’s generous improvidence
by strongly advising me, in view of
my bad financial position, to abandon my
theoretical career. I followed his advice, left
the physiological laboratory and entered the
General Hospital<a id="r7"></a><a class="c014 pginternal" href="#f7"><sup>[7]</sup></a> as an “Aspirant.” I was
soon afterwards promoted to being a junior
physician, and worked in various departments
of the hospital, amongst others for more than
six months under Meynert, by whose work
and personality I had been greatly struck
while I was still a student.</p>

<p class="c009">In a certain sense I nevertheless remained
<span class="pageno" id="Page_197">197</span>faithful to the line of work upon which I had
originally started. The subject which Brücke
had proposed for my investigations had been
the spinal cord of one of the lowest of the
fishes (Ammocoetes Petromyzon); and I now
passed on to the human central nervous system.
Just at this time Flechsig’s discoveries of
the non-simultaneity of the formation of the
medullary sheaths were throwing a revealing
light upon the intricate course of its
tracts. The fact that I began by choosing the
medulla oblongata as the one and only subject
of my work was another sign of the continuity
of my development. In complete contrast
to the diffuse character of my studies during
my earlier years at the University, I was
now developing an inclination to concentrate
my work exclusively upon a single subject or
problem. This inclination has persisted and
has since led to my being accused of one-sidedness.</p>

<p class="c009">I now became as active a worker in the Institute
of Cerebral Anatomy as I had previously
been in the physiological one. Some
short papers upon the course of the tracts and
<span class="pageno" id="Page_198">198</span>the nuclear origins in the medulla oblongata
date from these hospital years, and my results
were regularly noted down by Edinger. One
day Meynert, who had given me access to the
laboratory even during the times when I was
not actually working under him, proposed that
I should definitely devote myself to the anatomy
of the brain, and promised to hand over
his lecturing work to me, as he felt he was too
old to manage the newer methods. This I declined,
in alarm at the magnitude of the task;
it is possible, too, that I had guessed already
that this great man was by no means kindly
disposed towards me.</p>

<p class="c009">From the practical point of view, brain anatomy
was certainly no better than physiology,
and, with an eye to material considerations,
I began to study nervous diseases. There were,
at that time, few specialists in that branch of
medicine in Vienna, the material for its study
was distributed over a number of different departments
of the hospital, there was no satisfactory
opportunity of learning the subject,
and one was forced to be one’s own teacher.
Even Nothnagel, who had been appointed a
<span class="pageno" id="Page_199">199</span>short time before, on account of his book upon
cerebral localization, did not single out neuropathology
from among the other subdivisions
of medicine. In the distance glimmered the
great name of Charcot; so I formed a plan of
first obtaining an appointment as Lecturer on
Nervous Diseases in Vienna and of then going
to Paris to continue my studies.</p>

<p class="c009">In the course of the following years, while I
continued to work as a junior physician, I published
a number of clinical observations upon
organic diseases of the nervous system. I gradually
became familiar with the ground; I was
able to localize the site of a lesion in the medulla
oblongata so accurately that the pathological
anatomist had no further information
to add; I was the first person in Vienna to
send a case for autopsy with a diagnosis of
polyneuritis acuta. The fame of my diagnoses
and their <em>post mortem</em> confirmation brought
me an influx of American physicians, to whom
I lectured upon the patients in my department
in a sort of pidgin-English. I understood nothing
about the neuroses. On one occasion I introduced
to my audience a neurotic suffering
<span class="pageno" id="Page_200">200</span>from a persistent headache as a case of chronic
localized meningitis; they quite rightly rose
in revolt against me, and my premature activities
as a teacher came to an end. By way of
excuse I may add that this happened at a time
when greater authorities than myself in Vienna
were in the habit of diagnosing neurasthenia
as cerebral tumor.</p>

<p class="c009">In the spring of 1885 I was appointed Lecturer
on Neuropathology on the ground of my
histological and clinical publications. Soon
afterwards, as the result of a warm testimonial
from Brücke, I was awarded a Traveling
Fellowship of considerable value. In the
autumn of the same year I made the journey
to Paris.</p>

<p class="c009">I became a student at the Salpêtrière, but
as one of the crowd of foreign visitors, I had
little attention paid me to begin with. One
day in my hearing Charcot expressed his regret
that since the war he had heard nothing
from the German translator of his lectures;
he went on to say that he would be glad if
someone would undertake to translate the new
volume of his lectures into German. I wrote
<span class="pageno" id="Page_201">201</span>to him and offered to do so; I can still remember
a phrase in the letter, to the effect that I
suffered only from <em>l’aphasie motrice</em> and not
from <em>l’aphasie sensorielle du français</em>. Charcot
accepted the offer, I was admitted to the circle
of his personal acquaintances, and from that
time forward I took a full part in all that
went on at the Clinic.</p>

<p class="c009">As I write these lines, a number of papers
and newspaper-articles have reached me from
France, which gave evidence of a violent objection
to the acceptance of psychoanalysis,
and which often make the most inaccurate assertions
in regard to my relations with the
French school. I read, for instance, that I
made use of my visit to Paris to familiarize
myself with the theories of Pierre Janet and
then made off with my booty. I should therefore
like to say explicitly that during the
whole of my visit to the Salpêtrière, Janet’s
name was never so much as mentioned.</p>

<p class="c009">What impressed me most of all while I was
with Charcot were his latest investigations
upon hysteria, some of which were carried out
under my own eyes. He had proved, for instance,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_202">202</span>the genuineness of hysterical phenomena
and their conformity to laws (“<em>introite
et hic dii sunt</em>”), the frequent occurrence of
hysteria in men, the production of hysterical
paralyses and contractures by hypnotic suggestion
and the fact that such artificial products
showed, down to their smallest details,
the same features as spontaneous attacks,
which were often brought on traumatically.
Many of Charcot’s demonstrations began by
provoking in me and in other visitors a sense
of astonishment and an inclination to scepticism,
which we tried to justify by an appeal
to one of the theories of the day. He was always
friendly and patient in dealing with
such doubts, but he was also most decided;
it was in one of these discussions that (speaking
of theory) he remarked, “<i><span lang="fr">Ça n’empêche
pas d’exister</span></i>,” a <i><span lang="fr">mot</span></i> which left an indelible
mark upon my mind.</p>

<p class="c009">No doubt the whole of what Charcot taught
us at that time does not hold good today:
some of it has become doubtful, some has definitely
failed to withstand the test of time. But
enough is left over, and has found a permanent
<span class="pageno" id="Page_203">203</span>place in the storehouse of science. Before
leaving Paris I discussed with the great man
a plan for a comparative study of hysterical
and organic paralyses. I wished to establish
the thesis that in hysteria paralyses and anæsthesias
of the various parts of the body are
demarcated according to the popular idea of
their limits and not according to anatomical
facts. He agreed with this view, but it was
easy to see that in reality he took no special
interest in penetrating more deeply into the
psychology of the neuroses. When all is said
and done, it was from pathological anatomy
that his work had started.</p>

<p class="c009">Before I returned to Vienna I stopped for
a few weeks in Berlin, in order to gain a little
knowledge of the general disorders of childhood.
Kassowitz, who was at the head of a
public institute in Vienna for the treatment
of children’s diseases, had promised to put me
in charge of a department for the nervous
diseases of children. In Berlin I was given
assistance and a friendly reception by Baginsky.
In the course of the next few years I
published, from the Kassowitz Institute, several
<span class="pageno" id="Page_204">204</span>monographs of considerable size on unilateral
and bilateral cerebral palsies in children.
And for that reason, at a later date (in
1897), Nothnagel made me responsible for
dealing with the same subject in his great
<cite><span lang="de">Handbuch der allgemeinen und speziellen
Therapie</span></cite>.</p>

<p class="c009">In the autumn of 1886 I settled down in
Vienna as a physician, and married the girl
who had been waiting for me in a distant city
for more than four years. I may here go back
a little and explain how it was the fault of
my <em>fiancée</em> that I was not already famous at
that early age. A side interest, though it was
a deep one, had led me in 1884 to obtain from
Merck some of what was then the little-known
alkaloid cocaine and to study its physiological
action. While I was in the middle of this
work, an opportunity arose for making a
journey to visit my <em>fiancée</em>, from whom I had
been parted for two years. I hastily wound up
my investigation of cocaine and contented
myself in my book on the subject with prophesying
that further uses for it would soon be
found. I suggested, however, to my friend,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_205">205</span>L. Königstein, the ophthalmologist, that he
should investigate the question of how far the
anæsthetizing properties of cocaine were applicable
in diseases of the eye. When I returned
from my holiday I found that not he,
but another of my friends, Carl Koller (now
in New York), to whom I had also spoken
about cocaine, had made the decisive experiments
upon animals’ eyes and had demonstrated
them at the Ophthalmological Congress
at Heidelberg. Koller is therefore rightly
regarded as the discoverer of local anæsthesia
by cocaine, which has become so important in
minor surgery; but I bore my <em>fiancée</em> no
grudge for my neglected opportunity.</p>

<p class="c009">I will now return to the year of 1886, the
time of my settling down in Vienna as a specialist
in nervous diseases. The duty devolved
upon me of giving a report before the “Gesellschaft
der Aerzte” [Society of Medicine]
upon what I had seen and learnt with Charcot.
But I met with a bad reception. Persons of
authority, such as the chairman (Bamberger,
the physician), declared that what I said was
incredible. Meynert urged me to find some
<span class="pageno" id="Page_206">206</span>cases in Vienna similar to those which I had
described and to present them before the
Society. I tried to do so; but the senior physicians
in whose departments I found any
such cases, refused to allow me to observe
them or to work at them. One of them, an
old surgeon, actually broke out with the exclamation:
“But, my dear sir, how can you
talk such nonsense? <em>Hysteron</em> (sic) means the
uterus. So how can a man be hysterical?”
I objected in vain that what I wanted was,
not to have my diagnosis approved, but to have
the case put at my disposal. At length, outside
the hospital, I came upon a case of classical
hysterical hemi-anæsthesia in a man, and
demonstrated it before the “Gesellschaft der
Aerzte.” This time I was applauded, but no
further interest was taken in me. The impression
that the great authorities had rejected
my innovations remained unshaken; and, with
my hysteria in men and my production of
hysterical paralyses by suggestion, I found
myself forced into the Opposition. As I was
soon afterwards excluded from the laboratory
of cerebral anatomy and for a whole term had
<span class="pageno" id="Page_207">207</span>nowhere to deliver my lectures, I withdrew
from academic life and ceased to attend the
learned societies. It is a whole generation since
I have visited the “Gesellschaft der Aerzte.”</p>

<p class="c009">Anyone who wanted to make a living from
the treatment of nerve-patients must clearly
be able to do something to help them. My
therapeutic arsenal contained only two weapons,
electrotherapy and hypnosis, for prescribing
a visit to a hydropathic establishment after
a single consultation was an inadequate source
of income. My knowledge of electrotherapy
was derived from W. Erb’s text-book, which
provided detailed instructions for the treatment
of all the symptoms of nervous diseases.
Unluckily I was soon driven to see that following
these instructions was of no help whatever
and that what I had taken for an epitome
of exact observations was merely the construction
of phantasy. The realization that the
work of the greatest name in German neuropathology
had no more relation to reality
than some “Egyptian” dream-book, such as
are sold in cheap book-shops, was painful, but
it helped to rid me of yet another piece of the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_208">208</span>innocent faith in authority by which I was
still obsessed. So I put my electrical apparatus
aside, even before Möbius had solved the
problem by explaining that the successes of
electric treatment in nervous disorders (in so
far as there were any) were the effect of suggestion
on the part of the physician.</p>

<p class="c009">With hypnosis the case was better. While
I was still a student I had attended a public
exhibition given by the “magnetist” Hansen
and had noticed that one of the persons experimented
upon had became deathly pale at
the onset of cataleptic rigidity and had remained
so as long as that condition lasted. This
firmly convinced me of the genuineness of
the phenomena of hypnosis. Scientific support
was soon afterwards given to this view by
Heidenhain; but that did not restrain the professors
of psychiatry from declaring for a
long time to come that hypnosis was not only
fraudulent but dangerous and from regarding
hypnotists with contempt. In Paris I had seen
hypnosis used freely as a method for producing
symptoms in patients and then removing
them again. And now the news reached us
<span class="pageno" id="Page_209">209</span>that a school had arisen at Nancy which made
an extensive and remarkably successful use
of suggestion, with or without hypnosis, for
therapeutic purposes. It thus came about, as a
matter of course, that in the first years of my
activity as a physician my principal instrument
of work, apart from haphazard and unsystematic
psycho-therapeutic methods, was
hypnotic suggestion.</p>

<p class="c009">This implied, of course, that I abandoned
the treatment of organic nervous diseases; but
that was of little importance. For on the one
hand the prospects in the treatment of such
disorders were in any case never promising,
while on the other hand, in the private practice
of a physician working in a large town,
the quality of such patients was nothing compared
to the crowds of neurotics, whose
number seemed further multiplied by the
manner in which they hurried, with their
troubles unsolved, from one physician to another.
And apart from this, there was something
positively seductive in working with
hypnosis. For the first time there was a sense
of having overcome one’s impotence; and it
<span class="pageno" id="Page_210">210</span>was highly flattering to enjoy the reputation of
being a miracle-worker. It was not until later
that I was to discover the drawbacks of the
procedure. At the moment there were only
two points to complain of: first, that I could
not succeed in hypnotizing every patient, and
secondly, that I was unable to put individual
patients into as deep a state of hypnosis as I
should have wished. With the idea of perfecting
my hypnotic technique, I made a
journey to Nancy in the summer of 1889 and
spent several weeks there. I witnessed the
moving spectacle of old Liébault working
among the poor women and children of the
laboring classes, I was a spectator of Bernheim’s
astonishing experiments upon his
hospital patients, and I received the profoundest
impression of the possibility that
there could be powerful mental processes
which nevertheless remained hidden from the
consciousness of men. Thinking it would be
instructive, I had persuaded one of my patients
to follow me to Nancy. She was a very
highly gifted hysteric, a woman of good birth,
who had been handed over to me because no
<span class="pageno" id="Page_211">211</span>one knew what to do with her. By hypnotic
influence I had made it possible for her to
lead a tolerable existence and I was always
able to take her out of the misery of her condition.
But she always relapsed again after a
short time, and in my ignorance I attributed
this to the fact that her hypnosis had never
reached the stage of somnambulism with
amnesia. Bernheim now attempted several
times to bring this about, but he too failed.
He frankly admitted to me that his great
therapeutic successes by means of suggestion
were only achieved in his hospital practice
and not with his private patients. I had many
stimulating conversations with him, and undertook
to translate into German his two
works upon suggestion and its therapeutic effects.</p>

<p class="c009">During the period from 1886 to 1891 I did
little scientific work, and published scarcely
anything. I was occupied with establishing
myself in my new profession and with assuring
my own material existence as well as that
of a rapidly increasing family. In 1891 there
appeared the first of my studies upon the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_212">212</span>cerebral palsies of children, which was written
in collaboration with my friend and assistant,
Dr. Oskar Rie. An invitation which I received
in the same year to contribute to an encyclopædia
of medicine led me to investigate the
theory of aphasia, which was at that time
dominated by the views of Wernicke and
Lichtheim, which laid stress exclusively upon
localization. The fruit of this inquiry was a
small critical and speculative book, <cite><span lang="de">Zur Auffassung
der Aphasie</span></cite>. But I must now show
how it happened that scientific research once
more became the chief interest of my life.</p>

  <h3 class="c001">II</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-capa0_0_6 c008">I must supplement what I have just said
by explaining that from the very first I
made use of hypnosis in another manner, apart
from hypnotic suggestion. I used it for questioning
the patient upon the origin of his
symptom, which in his waking state he could
often describe only very imperfectly or not at
all. Not only did this method seem more effective
than bald suggestive commands or prohibitions,
but it also satisfied the curiosity of
the physician, who, after all, had a right to
learn something of the origin of the phenomenon
which he strove to remove by the
monotonous procedure of suggestion.</p>

<p class="c009">The manner in which I arrived at this other
procedure was as follows: While I was still
working in Brücke’s laboratory I had made
the acquaintance of Dr. Josef Breuer, who was
one of the most respected family physicians
in Vienna, but who also had a scientific past,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_214">214</span>since he had produced several works of
permanent value upon the physiology of
breathing and upon the organ of equilibrium.
He was a man of striking intelligence and
fourteen years older than myself. Our relations
soon became more intimate and he became
my friend and helper in my difficult
circumstances. We grew accustomed to share
all our scientific interests with each other. In
this relationship the gain was naturally mine.
The development of psychoanalysis afterwards
cost me his friendship. It was not easy
for me to pay such a price, but I could not
escape it.</p>

<p class="c009">Even before I went to Paris, Breuer had
told me about a case of hysteria which, between
1880 and 1882, he had treated in a peculiar
manner which had allowed him to penetrate
deeply into the causation and significance of
hysterical symptoms. This was at a time, therefore,
when Janet’s works still belonged to the
future. He repeatedly read me pieces of the
case history, and I had an impression that it
accomplished more towards an understanding
of neuroses than any previous observation. I
<span class="pageno" id="Page_215">215</span>determined to inform Charcot of these discoveries
when I reached Paris, and I actually
did so. But the great man showed no interest in
my first outline of the subject, so that I never
recurred to it and allowed it to pass from my
mind.</p>

<p class="c009">When I was back in Vienna I turned once
more to Breuer’s observation and made him
tell me more about it. The patient had been a
young girl of unusual education and gifts, who
had fallen ill while she was nursing her father,
of whom she was devotedly fond. When
Breuer took over her case it presented a
variegated picture of paralyses and contractures,
inhibitions and states of mental
confusion. A chance observation showed her
physician that she could be relieved of these
clouded states of consciousness if she was induced
to express in words the affective phantasy
by which she was at the moment dominated.
From this discovery, Breuer arrived
at a new method of treatment. He put her
into deep hypnosis and made her tell him each
time what it was that was oppressing her mind.
After the attacks of depressive confusion had
<span class="pageno" id="Page_216">216</span>been overcome in this way, he employed the
same procedure for removing her inhibitions
and physical disorders. In her waking state
the girl could no more describe than other
patients how her symptoms had arisen, and she
could discover no link between them and any
experiences of her life. In hypnosis she immediately
revealed the missing connection. It
turned out that all of her symptoms went back
to moving events which she had experienced
while nursing her father; that is to say, her
symptoms had a meaning and were residues
or reminiscences of those emotional situations.
It turned out in most instances that there had
been some thought or impulse which she had
had to suppress while she was by her father’s
sick-bed, and that, in place of it, as a substitute
for it, the symptom had afterwards appeared.
But as a rule the symptom was not
the precipitate of a single such “traumatic”
scene, but the result of a summation of a
number of similar situations. When the patient
recalled a situation of this kind in a hallucinatory
way under hypnosis and carried through
to its conclusion, with a free expression of
<span class="pageno" id="Page_217">217</span>emotion, the mental act which she had originally
suppressed, the symptom was wiped
away and did not return. By this procedure
Breuer succeeded, after long and painful efforts,
in relieving his patient of all her symptoms.</p>

<p class="c009">The patient had recovered and had remained
well and, in fact, had become capable
of doing serious work. But over the final stage
of this hypnotic treatment there rested a veil
of obscurity, which Breuer never raised for
me; and I could not understand why he had so
long kept secret what seemed to me an invaluable
discovery instead of making science
the richer by it. The immediate question, however,
was whether it was possible to generalize
from what he had found in a single case. The
state of things which he had discovered
seemed to me to be of so fundamental a nature
that I could not believe it could fail to be present
in any case of hysteria if it had been
proved to occur in a single one. But the question
could only be decided by experience. I
therefore began to repeat Breuer’s investigations
with my own patients and eventually,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_218">218</span>especially after my visit to Bernheim in 1889
had taught me the limitations of hypnotic
suggestion, I worked at nothing else. After
observing for several years that his findings
were invariably confirmed in every case of
hysteria that was accessible to such treatment,
and after having accumulated a considerable
amount of material in the shape of observations
analogous to his, I proposed to him that
we should issue a joint publication. At first
he objected vehemently, but in the end he gave
way, especially since, in the meantime, Janet’s
works had anticipated some of his results,
such as the tracing back of hysterical symptoms
to events in the patient’s life, and their
removal by means of hypnotic reproduction
<em>in statu nascendi</em>. In 1893 we issued a preliminary
paper, “On the Psychical Mechanism
of Hysterical Phenomena,”<a id="r8"></a><a class="c014 pginternal" href="#f8"><sup>[8]</sup></a> and in
1895 there followed our book, <cite><span lang="de">Studien über
Hysterie</span></cite>.</p>

<p class="c009">If the account I have so far given has led the
reader to expect that the <cite><span lang="de">Studien über Hysterie</span></cite>
must, in all essentials of their material content,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_219">219</span>be the product of Breuer’s mind, that is precisely
what I myself have always maintained
and what it has been my aim to repeat here.
As regards the theory put forward in the book,
I was partly responsible, but to an extent
which it is today no longer possible to determine.
That theory was in any case unpretentious
and hardly went beyond the direct description
of the observations. It did not seek
to establish the nature of hysteria but merely
to throw light upon the origin of its symptoms.
Thus it laid stress upon the significance of the
life of the emotions and upon the importance
of distinguishing between mental acts which
are unconscious and those which are conscious
(or rather capable of being conscious); it
introduced a dynamic factor, by supposing
that a symptom arises through the damming-up
of an effect, and an economic factor, by
regarding that same symptom as the product
or equivalent of a quantity of energy which
would otherwise have been employed in some
other way. (This latter process was described
as <em>conversion</em>.) Breuer spoke of our method
as <em>cathartic</em>; its therapeutic aim was explained
<span class="pageno" id="Page_220">220</span>as being to provide that the accumulated
affect used for maintaining the symptom,
which had got onto the wrong lines and had,
as it were, become stuck there, should be
directed onto the normal path along which it
could obtain discharge (or <em>abreaction</em>). The
practical results of the cathartic procedure
were excellent. Its defects, which became
evident later, were those of all forms of hypnotic
treatment. There are still a number of
psychotherapists who have not gone beyond
catharsis as Breuer understood it and who
still speak in its favor. Its value as an
abridged method of treatment was shown
afresh in the hands of E. Simmel in the treatment
of war neuroses in the German army
during the Great War. The theory of catharsis
had not much to say on the subject of
sexuality. In the case histories which I contributed
to the <cite><span lang="de">Studien</span></cite>, sexual factors played
a certain part, but scarcely more attention was
paid to them than to other emotional excitations.
Breuer wrote of the girl, who has since
become famous as his first patient, that her
sexual side was extraordinarily undeveloped.
<span class="pageno" id="Page_221">221</span>It would have been difficult to guess from the
<cite><span lang="de">Studien über Hysterie</span></cite> what an importance
sexuality has in the ætiology of the neuroses.</p>

<p class="c009">The stage of development which now followed,
the transition from catharsis to psychoanalysis
proper, has been described by me
several times already in such detail that I
shall find it difficult to bring forward any new
facts. The event which formed the opening
of this period was Breuer’s retirement from
our common work, so that I became sole administrator
of his legacy. There had been differences
of opinion between us at quite an
early stage, but they had not been a ground
for our separating. In answering the question
of when it is that a mental process becomes
pathogenic, that is, when it is that it becomes
impossible for it to find a normal discharge,
Breuer preferred what might be called a
physiological theory: he thought that the processes
which could not find normal outcome
were such as had originated during unusual,
hypnoid, mental states. This opened the
further question of the origin of these hypnoid
states. I, on the other hand, was inclined to
<span class="pageno" id="Page_222">222</span>suspect the existence of an interplay of forces
and the operation of intentions and purposes
such as are to be observed in normal life. Thus
it was a case of “Hypnoid Hysteria” versus
“Defence Neurosis.” But such differences as
this would scarcely have alienated him from
the subject if there had not been other factors
at work. One of these was undoubtedly that his
work as a physician and family doctor took
up much of his time and that he could not,
like me, devote his whole strength to the work
of catharsis. Again, he was affected by the
reception which our book had received both
in Vienna and in Germany. His self-confidence
and powers of resistance were not developed
so fully as the rest of his mental organization.
When, for instance, the <cite><span lang="de">Studien</span></cite> met with a
severe rebuff from Strümpell, I was able to
laugh at the lack of comprehension which
his criticism showed, but Breuer felt hurt
and grew discouraged. But what contributed
chiefly to his decision was that my own
further work led in a direction with which he
found it impossible to reconcile himself.</p>

<p class="c009">The theory which we had attempted to
<span class="pageno" id="Page_223">223</span>construct in the <cite><span lang="de">Studien</span></cite> remained, as I have
said, very incomplete; and in particular we
had scarcely touched upon the problem of
ætiology, upon the question of the ground
in which the pathogenic process takes root.
I now learned from my rapidly increasing
experience that it was not <em>any</em> kind of emotional
excitation that was in action behind
the phenomena of the neurosis but regularly
one of a sexual nature, whether it was a current
sexual conflict or the effect of earlier
sexual experiences. I was not prepared for
this conclusion and my expectations played
no part in it, for I had begun my investigation
of neurotics quite unsuspectingly. While
I was writing my “History of the Psycho-Analytic
Movement” in 1914, there recurred
to my mind some remarks that had been made
to me by Breuer, Charcot and Chrobak, which
might have led me to this discovery earlier.
But at the time I heard them I did not understand
what these authorities meant; indeed
they had told me more than they knew themselves
or were prepared to defend. What I
heard from them lay dormant and passive
<span class="pageno" id="Page_224">224</span>within me, until the chance of my cathartic
experiments brought it out as an apparently
original discovery. Nor was I then aware that
in deriving hysteria from sexuality, I was
going back to the very beginnings of medicine
and following up a thought of Plato’s. It was
not until later that I learnt this from an essay
by Havelock Ellis.</p>

<p class="c009">Under the influence of my surprising discovery,
I now took a momentous step. I went
beyond the domain of hysteria and began to
investigate the sexual life of the so-called
neurasthenics who used to visit me in numbers
during my consultation hours. This experiment
cost me, it is true, my popularity as a
doctor, but it brought me convictions which
today, almost thirty years later, have lost
none of their force. There was a great deal of
equivocation and mystery-making to be overcome,
but once that had been done, it turned
out that in all of these patients grave abuses
of the sexual function were present. Considering
how extremely widespread are these
abuses on the one hand and neurasthenia on
the other, a frequent coincidence between the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_225">225</span>two would not have proved much; but there
was more in it than that one bald fact. Closer
observation suggested to me that it was possible
to pick out from the confused jumble of
clinical pictures covered by the name of neurasthenia
two fundamentally different types,
which might appear in any degree of mixture
but which were nevertheless to be observed in
their pure forms. In the one type the central
phenomenon was the anxiety attack with its
equivalents, rudimentary forms and chronic
surrogate symptoms; I consequently gave it
the name of <em>anxiety neurosis</em>, and limited the
term <em>neurasthenia</em> to the other type. Now it
was easy to establish the fact that each of these
types have a different abnormality of sexual
life as its corresponding ætiological factor:
in the former case <em>coitus interruptus</em>, undischarged
excitement and sexual abstinence, and
in the latter, excessive masturbation and too
numerous nocturnal emissions. In a few specially
instructive cases, which had shown a surprising
alternation in the clinical picture from
one type to the other, it was possible to prove
that there had been a corresponding change
<span class="pageno" id="Page_226">226</span>in the underlying sexual <em>régime</em>. If it was possible
to put an end to the abuse and allow its
place to be taken by normal sexual activity, a
striking improvement in the condition was
the reward.</p>

<p class="c009">I was thus led into regarding the neuroses
as being without exception disturbances of
the sexual function, the so-called “actual”
neuroses being the direct toxic expression of
such disturbances and the psycho-neuroses
their mental expression. My conscience as a
physician felt pleased at my having arrived
at this conclusion. I hoped that I had filled
up a gap in medical science, which, in dealing
with a function of such great biological importance,
had failed to take into account any
injuries beyond those caused by infection or by
gross anatomical lesions. The standpoint of
medicine was, moreover, favored by the view
that sexuality was not something purely mental.
It had a somatic side as well, and it was
possible to assign special chemical processes to
it and to attribute sexual excitement to the
presence of some particular, though at present
unknown, substance. There must also have
<span class="pageno" id="Page_227">227</span>been some good reason why the true spontaneous
neuroses resembled no group of diseases
more closely than the phenomena of intoxication
and abstinence, which are produced by
the administration or privation of certain toxic
substances, or than Basedow’s disease, which is
known to depend upon the product of the thyroid
gland.</p>

<p class="c009">Since that time I have had no opportunity
of returning to the investigation of the actual
neuroses; nor has this part of my work been
continued by anyone else. If I look back today
at my early findings, they strike me as being
the first rough outlines of what is probably
a far more complicated subject. But on the
whole they seem to me still to hold good. I
should have been very glad if I had been able,
later on, to make a psychoanalytical examination
of some more cases of simple juvenile
neurasthenia, but unluckily the occasion did
not arise. To avoid misconceptions, I should
like to make it clear that I am far from denying
the existence of mental conflicts and of
neurotic complexes in neurasthenia. All that
I am asserting is that the symptoms of these
<span class="pageno" id="Page_228">228</span>patients are not mentally determined or removable
by analysis, but that they must be
regarded as direct toxic consequences of disturbed
sexual chemical processes.</p>

<p class="c009">During the years that followed the publication
of the <cite><span lang="de">Studien</span></cite>, having reached these conclusions
upon the part played by sexuality in
the ætiology of the neuroses, I read some
papers on the subject before various medical
societies, but was only met with incredulity
and contradiction. Breuer did what he could
for some time longer to throw the great weight
of his personal influence into the scales in my
favor, but he effected nothing and it was
easy to see that he too shrank from recognizing
the sexual ætiology of the neuroses. He
might have crushed me or at least disconcerted
me by pointing to his own first patient, in
whose case sexual factors had ostensibly played
no part whatever. But he never did so, and
I could not understand why this was until I
came to interpret the case correctly and to reconstruct,
from some remarks which he had
made, the conclusion of his treatment of it.
After the work of catharsis had seemed to be
<span class="pageno" id="Page_229">229</span>completed, the girl had suddenly developed
a condition of “transference love”; he had not
connected this with her illness, and had therefore
retired in dismay. It was obviously painful
to him to be reminded of this apparent
<em>contretemps</em>. His attitude towards me oscillated
for some time between appreciation and
bitter criticism; then accidental difficulties
arose, as they never fail to do in a strained
situation, and we parted.</p>

<p class="c009">Another result of my taking up the study
of nervous disorders in general was that I
altered the technique of catharsis. I abandoned
hypnosis and sought to replace it by some
other method, because I was anxious not to
be restricted to treating hysteriform conditions.
Increasing experience had also given
rise to two grave doubts in my mind as to the
use of hypnosis even as a means to catharsis.
The first was that even the most brilliant results
were liable to be suddenly wiped away if
my personal relation with the patient became
disturbed. It was true that they became reestablished
if a reconciliation could be effected;
but such an occurrence showed that the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_230">230</span>personal emotional relation between doctor
and patient was after all stronger than the
whole cathartic process, and it was precisely
that factor which escaped every effort at control.
And one day I had an experience which
showed me in the crudest light what I had
long suspected. One of my most acquiescent
patients, with whom hypnosis had enabled
me to bring about the most marvellous results,
and whom I was engaged in relieving of
her suffering by tracing back her attacks of
pain to their origins, as she woke up on one
occasion, threw her arms round my neck. The
unexpected entrance of a servant relieved us
from a painful discussion, but from that time
onwards there was a tacit understanding between
us that hypnotic treatment should be
discontinued. I was modest enough not to attribute
the event to my own irresistible personal
attraction, and I felt that I had now
grasped the nature of the element of mystery
that was at work behind hypnosis. In order
to exclude it, or at all events to isolate it, it
was necessary to abandon hypnosis.</p>

<p class="c009">But hypnosis had been of immense help in
<span class="pageno" id="Page_231">231</span>the cathartic treatment, by widening the field
of the patient’s consciousness and putting
within his reach knowledge which he did not
possess in his waking life. It seemed no easy
task to find a substitute for it. While I was in
this perplexity, a recollection came to my help
of an experiment which I had often witnessed
while I was with Bernheim. When the subject
awoke from the state of somnambulism, he
seemed to have lost all memory of what had
happened while he was in that state. But
Bernheim maintained that the memory was
present all the same; and if he insisted on the
subject remembering, if he asseverated that he
knew it all and had only to say it, and if at
the same time he laid his hand on the subject’s
forehead, then the forgotten memories
used in fact to return, hesitatingly at first, but
eventually in a flood and with complete clarity.
I determined that I would act in the same way.
My patients, I reflected, must in fact “know”
all the things which had hitherto only been
made accessible to them by hypnosis; and assurances
and encouragement on my part, assisted
perhaps by the touch of my hand, would,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_232">232</span>I thought, have the power of forcing the forgotten
facts and connections into consciousness.
No doubt this seemed a more laborious
process than putting them under hypnosis, but
it might prove highly instructive. So I abandoned
hypnosis, only retaining my practice
of requiring the patient to lie upon a sofa
while I sat behind him, seeing him, but not
seen myself.</p>

<div>
  <span class="pageno" id="Page_233">233</span>
  <h3 class="c001">III</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-capa0_0_6 c008">My expectations were fulfilled; I was set
free from hypnosis. But along with the
change in technique, the process of catharsis
took on a new complexion. Hypnosis had
screened from view an interplay of forces
which now came in sight, and the understanding
of which gave a solid foundation to my
theory.</p>

<p class="c009">How had it come about that the patients
had forgotten so many of the facts of their
external and internal lives, but could nevertheless
recollect them if a particular technique
was applied? Observation supplied an exhaustive
answer to these questions. Everything
that had been forgotten had in some way or
other been painful; it had been either alarming
or disagreeable or shameful, by the standards
of the subject’s personality. The thought
arose spontaneously: it was precisely on that
account that it had been forgotten, i. e. that
<span class="pageno" id="Page_234">234</span>it had not remained conscious. In order to
make it conscious again, in spite of this, it was
necessary to overcome something that fought
against one in the patient; it was necessary to
make an expenditure of effort on one’s own
part in order to compel and subdue it. The
amount of effort required of the physician
varied in different cases; it increased in direct
proportion to the difficulty of what had to be
remembered. The expenditure of force on the
part of the physician was evidently the measure
of a <em>resistance</em> on the part of the patient.
It was only necessary to translate into words
what I myself had observed, and I was in possession
of the theory of <em>repression</em>.</p>

<p class="c009">It was now easy to reconstruct the pathogenic
process. Let us keep to a simple example,
in which a particular impulsion had
arisen in the subject’s mind, but was opposed
by other powerful tendencies. We should have
expected the mental <em>conflict</em> which now arose
to take the following course. The two dynamic
quantities—for our present purposes let us
call them “the instinct” and “the resistance”—would
struggle with each other for some time
<span class="pageno" id="Page_235">235</span>in the fullest light of consciousness, until the
instinct was repudiated and the charge<a id="r9"></a><a class="c014 pginternal" href="#f9"><sup>[9]</sup></a> of
energy withdrawn from it. This would have
been the normal solution. In a neurosis, however,
(for reasons which were still unknown)
the conflict found a different outcome. The
ego drew back, as it were, after the first shock
of its conflict with the objectionable impulse;
it debarred the impulse from access to consciousness
and to direct motor discharge, but
at the same time the impulse retained its full
charge of energy. I named this process <em>repression</em>;
it was a novelty, and nothing like it
had ever before been recognized in mental
life. It was obviously a primary mechanism
of defence, comparable to an attempt at flight,
and was only a fore-runner of the later developed
normal condemning judgment. The
first act of repression involved further consequences.
In the first place, the ego was obliged
to protect itself against the constant threat of a
<span class="pageno" id="Page_236">236</span>renewed advance on the part of the repressed
impulse by making a permanent expenditure
of energy, a <em>counter-charge</em>, and it thus impoverished
itself. On the other hand, the repressed
impulse, which was now <em>unconscious</em>,
was able to find means of discharge and of
substitutive gratification by circuitous routes
and thus to bring the whole purpose of the repression
to nothing. In the case of conversion-hysteria,
the circuitous route led to the nerve
supply of the body; the repressed impulse
broke through at some point or other and produced
<em>symptoms</em>. The symptoms were thus
results of a compromise, for although they
were substitutive gratifications, they were
nevertheless distorted and deflected from their
aim, owing to the resistance of the ego.</p>

<p class="c009">The theory of repression became the
foundation-stone of our understanding of the
neuroses. A different view had now to be taken
of the task of therapy. Its aim was no longer
to “abreact” an effect which had got onto the
wrong lines, but to uncover repressions and
replace them by acts of judgment which
might result either in the acceptance or in the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_237">237</span>rejection of what had formerly been repudiated.
I showed my recognition of the new
situation by no longer calling my method of
investigation and treatment <em>catharsis</em> but
<em>psychoanalysis</em>.</p>

<p class="c009">It is possible to take repression as a centre
and to bring all the elements of psychoanalytic
theory into relation with it. But before
doing so, I have a further remark of a
polemical nature to make. According to
Janet’s view, a hysteric was a wretched person
who, on account of a constitutional weakness,
was unable to hold her mental acts together,
and it was for that reason that she fell a victim
to mental dissociation and to a restriction
of the field of her consciousness. The results
of psychoanalytical investigations, on the
other hand, showed that these phenomena
were the result of dynamic factors—of mental
conflict and of repression. This distinction
seems to me to be far-reaching enough to put
an end to the glib repetition of the view that
whatever is of value in psychoanalysis is
merely borrowed from the ideas of Janet. The
reader will have learned from my account
<span class="pageno" id="Page_238">238</span>that historically psychoanalysis is completely
independent of Janet’s discoveries, just as, in
its content, it diverges from them and goes far
beyond them. Janet’s works would never have
had the implications which have made psychoanalysis
of such importance to the mental
sciences and have made it attract such universal
interest. I always treated Janet himself
with respect, since his discoveries coincided,
to a considerable extent, with those of
Breuer, which had been made earlier, but
were published later than his. But when, in
the course of time, psychoanalysis became a
subject of discussion in France, Janet behaved
ill, showed ignorance of the facts and used
ugly arguments. And finally he revealed himself
to my eyes and destroyed the value of his
own work by declaring that when he had
spoken of ‘unconscious’ mental acts, he had
meant nothing by the phrase—it had been no
more than a <em>façon de parler</em>.</p>

<p class="c009">But the study of pathogenic repressions and
of other phenomena which have still to be
mentioned compelled psychoanalysis to take
the concept of the “unconscious” seriously.
<span class="pageno" id="Page_239">239</span>Psychoanalysis regarded everything mental
as being in the first instance unconscious; the
further quality of “consciousness” might also
be present, or again it might be absent. This,
of course, provoked a denial from the philosophers,
for whom “conscious” and “mental”
were identical, and who protested that they
could not conceive of such a monstrosity as the
“unconscious mental.” There was no help for
it, however, and this idiosyncrasy of the philosophers
could only be disregarded with a
shrug. Experience (gained from pathological
material, of which the philosophers were ignorant)
of the frequency and power of impulses
of which one knew nothing directly,
and whose existence had to be inferred like
some fact in the external world, left no alternative
open. It could be pointed out, incidentally,
that this was only treating one’s own
mental life as one had always treated other
people’s. One did not hesitate to ascribe mental
processes to other people, although one
had no immediate consciousness of them and
could only infer them from their words and
actions. But what held good for other people
<span class="pageno" id="Page_240">240</span>must be applicable to oneself. Anyone who
tried to push the argument further and to
conclude from it that one’s own hidden processes
belonged actually to a second consciousness
would be faced with the concept of a
consciousness of which one knew nothing, of
an “unconscious consciousness”—and this
would scarcely be preferable to the assumption
of an “unconscious mental.” If, on the
other hand, one declared, like some other
philosophers, that one was prepared to take
pathological phenomena into account, but
that the processes underlying them ought not
to be described as mental but as “psychoid,”
the difference of opinion would degenerate
into an unfruitful dispute about words,
though, even so, expediency would decide in
favour of keeping the expression “unconscious
mental.” The further question as to the ultimate
nature of this unconscious is no wiser
or more profitable than the older one as to the
nature of the conscious.</p>

<p class="c009">It would be more difficult to explain concisely
how it came about that psychoanalysis
made a further distinction in the unconscious,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_241">241</span>and separated it into a <em>preconscious</em> and an
unconscious proper. It will be sufficient to say
that it appeared a legitimate course to supplement
the theories which were a direct expression
of experience by hypotheses which were
designed to facilitate the handling of the material
and related to matters which could not
be a subject of immediate observation. The
very same procedure is adopted by the older
sciences. The sub-division of the unconscious
is part of an attempt to picture the apparatus
of the mind as being built up of a number of
<em>instances</em> or systems, whose inter-relations may
be expressed in spatial terms, without reference,
of course, to the actual anatomy of the
brain. (I have described this as the <em>topographical
method of approach</em>.) Such ideas as these
are part of a speculative superstructure of
psychoanalysis, any portion of which can be
abandoned or changed without loss or regret
the moment its inadequacy has been proved.
But there is still plenty to be described that
lies closer to actual experience.</p>

<p class="c009">I have already mentioned that my investigation
of the precipitating and underlying
<span class="pageno" id="Page_242">242</span>causes of the neuroses led me more and more
frequently to conflicts between the subject’s
sexual impulses and his resistances to sexuality.
In my search for the pathogenic situations
in which the repressions of sexuality had
set in and in which the symptoms, as substitutes
for what was repressed, had their origin,
I was carried further and further back into
the patient’s life and ended by reaching the
first years of his childhood. What poets and
students of human nature had always asserted
turned out to be true: the impressions of that
remote period of life, though they were for
the most part buried in amnesia, left ineradicable
traces upon the individual’s growth and
in particular laid the foundations of any nervous
disorder that was to follow. But since
these experiences of childhood were always
concerned with sexual excitations and the reaction
against them, I found myself faced by
the fact of infantile sexuality—once again a
novelty and a contradiction of one of the
strongest of human prejudices. Childhood was
looked upon as “innocent” and free from the
lusts of sex, and the fight with the demon of
<span class="pageno" id="Page_243">243</span>“sensuality” was not thought to begin until the
troubled age of puberty. Such occasional
sexual activities as it had been impossible to
overlook in children were put down as signs
of degeneracy and premature depravity or as
a curious freak of nature. Few of the findings
of psychoanalysis have met with such universal
contradiction or have aroused such an outburst
of indignation as the assertion that the
sexual function starts at the beginning of life
and reveals its presence by important signs
even in childhood. And yet no other finding
of analysis can be demonstrated so easily and
so completely.</p>

<p class="c009">Before going further into the question of
infantile sexuality, I must mention an error
into which I fell for a while and which might
well have had fatal consequences for the
whole of my work. Under the pressure of the
technical procedure which I used at that time,
the majority of my patients reproduced from
their childhood, scenes in which they were
sexually seduced by some grown-up person.
With female patients the part of seducer was
almost always assigned to their father. I believed
<span class="pageno" id="Page_244">244</span>these stories, and consequently supposed
that I had discovered the roots of the subsequent
neurosis in these experiences of sexual
seduction in childhood. My confidence was
strengthened by a few cases in which relations
of this kind with a father, uncle or elder
brother had continued up to an age at which
memory was quite to be trusted. If the reader
feels inclined to shake his head at my credulity,
I cannot altogether blame him; though
I may plead that this was at a time when I
was intentionally keeping my critical faculty
in abeyance so as to preserve an unprejudiced
and receptive attitude towards the many novelties
which were coming to my notice every
day. When, however, I was at last obliged to
recognize that these scenes of seduction had
never taken place, and that they were only
phantasies which my patients had made up or
which I myself had perhaps forced upon
them, I was for some time completely at a
loss. My confidence alike in my technique and
in its results suffered a severe blow, it could
not be disputed that I had arrived at these
scenes by a technical method which I considered
<span class="pageno" id="Page_245">245</span>correct, and their subject-matter was unquestionably
related to the symptoms from
which my investigation had started. When I
had pulled myself together, I was able to draw
the right conclusions from my discovery:
namely, that the neurotic symptoms were not
related directly to actual events but to phantasies
embodying wishes, and that, as far as
the neurosis was concerned, psychical reality
was of more importance than material reality.
I do not believe even now that I forced the
seduction-phantasies upon my patients, that I
“suggested” them. I had, in fact, stumbled for
the first time upon the <em>Œdipus complex</em>,
which was later to assume such an overwhelming
importance, but which I did not recognize
as yet in its disguise of phantasy. Moreover,
seduction during childhood retained a certain
share, though a humbler one, in the ætiology
of neuroses. But the seducers turned out as a
rule to have been older children.</p>

<p class="c009">It will be seen, then, that my mistake was
of the same kind as would be made by someone
who believed that the legendary story of the
early kings of Rome (as told by Livy) was
<span class="pageno" id="Page_246">246</span>historical truth instead of what it is in fact—a
reaction against the memory of times and
circumstances that were insignificant and occasionally,
perhaps, inglorious. When the mistake
had been cleared up, the path to the
study of the sexual life of children lay open.
It thus became possible to apply psychoanalysis
to another field of science and to use
its data as a means of discovering a new piece
of biological knowledge.</p>

<p class="c009">The sexual function, as I found, is in existence
from the very beginning of the individual’s
life, though at first it is assimilated to
the other vital functions and does not become
independent of them until later; it has to pass
through a long and complicated process of
development before it becomes what we are
familiar with as the normal sexual life of the
adult. It begins by manifesting itself in the
activity of a whole number of <em>component
instincts</em>. These are dependent upon <em>erotogenic
zones</em> in the body; some of them make
their appearance in pairs of opposite impulses
(such as sadism and masochism or the
impulses to look and to be looked at); they
<span class="pageno" id="Page_247">247</span>operate independently of one another in their
search for pleasure, and they find their object
for the most part in the subject’s own body.
Thus, to begin with, they are non-centralized
and predominantly <em>auto-erotic</em>. Later they
begin to be co-ordinated; a first stage of organization
is reached under the dominance of the
<em>oral</em> components, an <em>anal-sadistic</em> stage follows,
and it is only after the third stage has
at last been reached that the primacy of the
<em>genitals</em> is established and that the sexual
function begins to serve the ends of reproduction.
In the course of this process of development
a number of elements of the various
component instincts turn out to be unserviceable
for this last end and are therefore
left on one side or turned to other uses, while
others are diverted from their aims and carried
over into the genital organization. I gave
the name of <em>libido</em> to the energy of the sexual
instincts and to that form of energy alone. I
was next driven to suppose that the libido does
not always pass through its prescribed course
of development smoothly. As a result either of
the excessive strength of certain of the components
<span class="pageno" id="Page_248">248</span>or of experiences involving premature
gratification, <em>fixations</em> of the libido may
occur at various points in the course of its
development. If subsequently a repression
takes place, the libido flows back to these
points (a process described as <em>regression</em>), and
it is from them that the energy breaks through
in the form of a symptom. Later on it further
became clear that the localization of the point
of fixation is what determines the <em>choice of
neurosis</em>, that is, the form in which the subsequent
illness makes its appearance.</p>

<p class="c009">The process of arriving at an object, which
plays an important part in mental life, takes
place alongside of the organization of the
libido. After the stage of auto-erotism, the
first love-object in the case of both sexes is
the mother; and it seems probable that, to
begin with, the child does not distinguish its
mother’s organ of nutrition from its own body.
Later, but still in the first years of infancy,
the relation known as the Œdipus complex,
becomes established: boys concentrate their
sexual wishes upon their mother and develop
hostile impulses against their father as being
<span class="pageno" id="Page_249">249</span>a rival, while girls develop an analogous attitude.
All of the different variations and consequences
of the Œdipus complex are important;
and in particular the innately bisexual
constitution of human beings makes itself felt
and increases the number of simultaneously active
tendencies. Children do not become clear
for quite a long time upon the differences
between the sexes; and during this period
of <em>sexual enquiry</em> they produce typical <em>sexual
theories</em> which, since they are limited by the
incompleteness of their authors’ own physical
development, are a mixture of truth and
error and fail to solve the problems of sexual
life (the riddle of the Sphinx, the question of
where babies come from). We see, then, that
a child’s first object-choice is an <em>incestuous</em>
one. The whole course of development that
I have described is run through rapidly. For
the most remarkable feature of the sexual life
of man is that it comes on in two waves, with
an interval between them. It reaches a first
climax in the fourth or fifth year of a child’s
life. But this early growth of sexuality is
nipped in the bud; the sexual impulses, which
<span class="pageno" id="Page_250">250</span>have shown such liveliness, are overcome by
repression, and a <em>period of latency</em> follows,
which lasts until puberty and during which
the “reaction-formations” of morality, shame
and disgust are built up. Of all living creatures,
man alone seems to show this double
onset of sexual growth, and it may perhaps
be the biological determinant of his predisposition
to neuroses. At puberty the impulses
and object-relations of a child’s early years
become re-animated, and amongst them the
emotional ties of his Œdipus complex. The
sexual life of puberty is a struggle between
the impulses of early years and the inhibitions
of the latency period. Before this, and while
the child is at the highest point of its infantile
sexual development, a genital organization of
a sort is established; but only the <em>male</em> genitals
play a part in it, and the female ones remain
undiscovered. (I have described this as the
period of <em>phallic</em> primacy.) At this stage the
contrast between the sexes is not stated in
terms of “male” or “female” but of “possessing
a penis” or “castrated.” The <em>castration
complex</em> which arises in this connexion is of
<span class="pageno" id="Page_251">251</span>the profoundest importance in the formation
alike of character and of neuroses.</p>

<p class="c009">In order to make this condensed account
of my discoveries as to the sexual life of man
more intelligible, I have brought together conclusions
which I reached at different dates
and incorporated by way of supplement or
correction in the successive editions of my
<cite>Three Contributions to the Theory of Sexuality</cite>.<a id="r10"></a><a class="c014 pginternal" href="#f10"><sup>[10]</sup></a>
I hope it will have been easy to gather
the nature of my extension (on which so
much stress has been laid and which has excited
so much opposition) of the concept of
sexuality. That extension is of a twofold kind.
In the first place sexuality is divorced from
its too close connection with the genitals and
is regarded as a more comprehensive bodily
function, having pleasure as its goal and only
secondarily coming to serve the ends of reproduction.
In the second place, the sexual impulses
are regarded as including all of those
merely affectionate and friendly impulses to
which usage applies the exceedingly ambiguous
<span class="pageno" id="Page_252">252</span>word ‘love.’ I do not, however, consider
that these extensions are innovations, but
rather restorations: they signify the removal
of inexpedient limitations of the concept into
which we had allowed ourselves to be led.</p>

<p class="c009">The detaching of sexuality from the genitals
has the advantage of allowing us to bring
the sexual activities of children and of perverts
into the same scope as those of normal
adults. The former have hitherto been entirely
neglected and, though the latter have been
recognized, it has been with moral indignation
and without understanding. Looked at
from the psychoanalytic standpoint, even the
most eccentric and repellent perversions are
explicable as manifestations of component instincts
of sexuality which have freed themselves
from the primacy of the genitals and
are going in pursuit of pleasure on their own
account as they did in the very early days of
the libido’s development. The most important
of these perversions, homosexuality, scarcely
deserves the name. It can be traced back to the
constitutional bisexuality of all human beings
and to the after-effects of the phallic primacy.
<span class="pageno" id="Page_253">253</span>Psychoanalysis enables us to point to some
trace or other of a homosexual object-choice
in everyone. If I have described children as
“poly-morphously perverse,” I was only using
a terminology that was generally current; no
moral judgment was implied by the phrase.
Psychoanalysis has no concern whatever with
such judgments of value.</p>

<p class="c009">The second of my alleged extensions of the
concept of sexuality finds its justification in
the fact revealed by psychoanalytic investigation,
that all of these affectionate impulses
were originally of a completely sexual nature
but have become <em>inhibited in their aim or
sublimated</em>. The manner in which the sexual
instincts can thus be influenced and diverted
enables them to be employed for cultural
activities of every kind, to which indeed they
bring the most important contributions.</p>

<p class="c009">My surprising discoveries as to the sexuality
of children were made in the first instance
through the analysis of adults. But later (from
about 1908 onwards) it became possible to
confirm them in the most satisfactory way and
in every detail by direct observations upon
<span class="pageno" id="Page_254">254</span>children. Indeed, it is so easy to convince oneself
of the regular sexual activities of children,
that one cannot help asking in astonishment
how the human race can have succeeded
in over-looking the facts and in maintaining
for so long the agreeable legend of the asexuality
of childhood. This surprising circumstance
must be connected with the amnesia
which, just as with the majority of adults,
hides their own infancy.</p>

<p class="drop-capa0_0_6 c008">The theories of resistance and of repression,
of the unconscious, of the ætiological
significance of sexual life and of the
importance of infantile experiences—these
form the principal constituents of the theoretical
structure of psychoanalysis. In these
pages, unfortunately, I have been able to describe
only the separate elements and not
their inter-connections and their bearing upon
one another. But I am obliged now to turn
to the alterations which gradually took place
in the technique of the analytic method.</p>

<p class="c009">The means which I first adopted for overcoming
the patient’s resistance, by pressing
and encouraging him, had been indispensable
for the purpose of giving me a first general
survey of what was to be expected. But in the
long run it proved to be too much of a strain
upon both sides and, further, it seemed open
to certain obvious criticisms. It therefore gave
<span class="pageno" id="Page_256">256</span>place to another method which was in one
sense its opposite. Instead of urging the patient
to say something upon some particular
subject, I now asked him to abandon himself
to a process of <em>free association</em>, i. e. to say
whatever came into his head, while ceasing to
give any conscious direction to his thoughts.
It was essential, however, that he should bind
himself to report literally everything that occurred
to his self-perception and not to give
way to critical objections which sought to put
certain associations on one side on the ground
that they were not sufficiently important or
that they were irrelevant or that they were altogether
meaningless. There was no necessity
to repeat explicitly the insistence upon the
need for candor on the patient’s part in reporting
his thoughts, for it was the precondition
of the whole analytic treatment.</p>

<p class="c009">It may seem surprising that this method of
free association, carried out subject to the observation
of <em>the fundamental rule of psychoanalysis</em>,
should have achieved what was expected
of it, namely the bringing into consciousness
of the repressed material which was
<span class="pageno" id="Page_257">257</span>held back by resistances. We must, however,
bear in mind that free association is not really
free. The patient remains under the influence
of the analytic situation even though he is not
directing his mental activities onto a particular
subject. We shall be justified in assuming
that nothing will occur to him that has not
some reference to that situation. His resistance
against reproducing the repressed material
will now be expressed in two ways. Firstly, it
will be shown by critical objections; and it
was to deal with these that the fundamental
rule of psychoanalysis was invented. But if
the patient observes that rule and so overcomes
his reticences, the resistance will find
another means of expression. It will so arrange
it that the repressed material itself will
never occur to the patient but only something
which approximates to it in an allusive way;
and the greater the resistance, the more remote
will be the substitutive association which
the patient has to report from the actual idea
that the analyst is in search of. The analyst,
who listens composedly, but without any constrained
effort, to the stream of associations
<span class="pageno" id="Page_258">258</span>and who, from his experience, has a general
notion of what to expect can make use of the
material brought to light by the patient according
to two possibilities. If the resistance
is slight, he will be able, from the patient’s
allusions, to infer the unconscious material itself;
or if the resistance is stronger, he will
be able to recognize from the associations, as
they seem to become more remote from the
subject, the character of the resistance itself
and will explain it to the patient. Uncovering
the resistance, however, is the first step towards
overcoming it. Thus the work of analysis
involves an <em>art of interpretation</em>, the successful
handling of which may require tact
and practice, but which is not hard to
acquire. But it is not only in the saving of labour
that the method of free association has an
advantage over the earlier method. It exposes
the patient to the least possible amount of
compulsion, it never allows of contact being
lost with the actual current situation, it guarantees
to a great extent that no factor in the
structure of the neurosis will be overlooked
and that nothing will be introduced into it by
<span class="pageno" id="Page_259">259</span>the expectations of the analyst. It is left to the
patient in all essentials to determine the course
of the analysis and the arrangement of the material;
any systematic handling of particular
symptoms or complexes thus becomes impossible.
In complete contrast to what happened
with hypnosis and with the urging method, inter-related
material makes its appearance at
different times and at different points in the
treatment. To a spectator, therefore—though,
in fact, there can be none—an analytic treatment
would seem completely obscure.</p>

<p class="c009">Another advantage of the method is that it
need never break down. It must theoretically
always be possible to have an association, provided
that no conditions are made as to its
character. Yet there is one case in which, in
fact, a break down occurs with absolute regularity;
from its very uniqueness, however, this
case, too can be interpreted.</p>

<p class="c009">I now come to the description of a factor
which adds an essential feature to my picture
of analysis and which can claim alike technically
and theoretically, to be regarded as of
the first importance. In every analytic treatment,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_260">260</span>there arises, without the physician’s
agency, an intense emotional relationship between
the patient and the analyst which is not
to be accounted for by the actual situation. It
can be of a positive or of a negative character,
and can vary between the extremes of a passionate,
completely sensual love and the unbridled
expression of an embittered defiance
and hatred. This <em>transference</em>—to give it its
shortened name—soon replaces, in the patient’s
mind, the desire to be cured, and, so
long as it is affectionate and moderate becomes
the agent of the physician’s influence and
neither more nor less than the main-spring of
the joint work of analysis. Later on, when it
has become passionate or has been converted
into hostility, it becomes the principal tool of
the resistance. It may then happen that it will
paralyse the patient’s powers of associating
and endanger the success of the treatment. Yet
it would be senseless to try to evade it; for an
analysis without transference is an impossibility.
It must not be supposed, however, that
the transference is created by analysis and
does not occur apart from it. The transference
<span class="pageno" id="Page_261">261</span>is merely uncovered and isolated by analysis.
It is a universal phenomenon of the human
mind, it decides the success of all medical influence
and, in fact, dominates the whole of
each person’s relations to his human environment.
We can easily recognize it as the same
dynamic factor that the hypnotists have
named “suggestibility,” which is the agent of
hypnotic <em>rapport</em> and the incalculable behavior
of which led to such difficulties with the
cathartic method. When there is no inclination
to a transference of emotion such as this,
or when it has become entirely negative, as
happens in dementia præcox or paranoia,
then there is also no possibility of influencing
the patient by psychological means.</p>

<p class="c009">It is perfectly true that psychoanalysis,
like other psycho-therapeutic methods, employs
the instrument of suggestion (or transference).
But the difference is this: that in
analysis it is not allowed to play the decisive
part in determining the therapeutic results.
It is used instead to induce the patient to perform
a piece of mental work—the overcoming
of his transference-resistances—which involves
<span class="pageno" id="Page_262">262</span>a permanent alteration in his mental
economy. The transference is made conscious
to the patient by the analyst, and it is resolved
by convincing him that in his transference-attitude
he is <em>re-experiencing</em> emotional relations
which had their origin in his earliest
object-relationships during the repressed
period of his childhood. In this way the transference
is changed from the strongest weapon
of the resistance into the best instrument of
the analytic treatment. Nevertheless, its handling
remains the most difficult as well as the
most important part of the technique of analysis.</p>

<p class="c009">With the help of the method of free association
and of the closely related art of interpretation,
psychoanalysis succeeded in
achieving something which appeared to be of
no practical importance but which, in fact,
necessarily led to a fresh attitude and a fresh
scale of values in scientific thought. It became
possible to prove that dreams have a
meaning and to discover it. In classical antiquity
great importance was attached to
dreams as foretelling the future; but modern
<span class="pageno" id="Page_263">263</span>science would have nothing to do with them,
it handed them over to superstition, declaring
them to be purely “somatic” processes—a
kind of spasm occurring in a mind that is
otherwise asleep. It seemed quite inconceivable
that anyone who had done serious scientific
work could make his appearance as an
“interpreter of dreams.” But by disregarding
the excommunication pronounced upon
dreams, by treating them as unexplained
neurotic symptoms, as delusional or obsessional
ideas, by neglecting their apparent content
and by making their separate component
images into subjects for free association, a different
conclusion was reached. The numerous
associations produced by the dreamer led to
the discovery of a mental structure which
could no longer be described as absurd or confused,
which was on an equality with any
other product of the mind, and of which the
<em>manifest</em> dream was no more than a distorted,
abbreviated and misunderstood translation
and usually a translation into visual images.
These <em>latent dream-thoughts</em> contained the
meaning of the dream, while its manifest content
<span class="pageno" id="Page_264">264</span>was simply a make-believe, a façade,
which could serve as a starting-point for the
associations but not for the interpretation.</p>

<p class="c009">There were now a whole series of questions
to be answered, among the most important
of them being whether there was a motive for
the formation of dreams, under what conditions
it took place, by what methods the
dream-thoughts (which are invariably full
of sense) became converted into the dream
(which is often senseless), and others besides.
I attempted to solve all of these problems in
<cite>The Interpretation of Dreams</cite>,<a id="r11"></a><a class="c014 pginternal" href="#f11"><sup>[11]</sup></a> which I published
in the year 1900. I can only find space
here for the briefest abstract of my investigation.
When the latent dream-thoughts that
are revealed by the analysis of a dream are
examined, one of them is found to stand out
from among the rest, which are intelligible
and well known to the dreamer. These latter
thoughts are residues of waking life (the <em>day’s
residues</em>, as they are called technically); but
the isolated thought is found to be an impulse
in the form of a wish, often of a very
<span class="pageno" id="Page_265">265</span>repellent kind, which is foreign to the waking
life of the dreamer and is consequently
disavowed by him with surprise or indignation.
This impulse is the actual constructor of
the dream: it provides the energy for its production
and makes use of the day’s residues as
material; the dream which thus originates
represents a situation in which the impulse
is satisfied, it is the fulfilment of the wish
which the impulse contains. It would not be
possible for this process to take place without
being favored by the presence of something
in the nature of a state of sleep. The
necessary mental precondition of sleep is the
concentration of the ego upon the wish to
sleep and the withdrawal of psychical energy
from all the interests of life; since at the same
time all the paths of approach to motility are
blocked, the ego is also able to reduce the expenditure
of energy by which at other times
it maintains the repressions. The unconscious
impulse makes use of this nocturnal relaxation
of repression in order to push its way into
consciousness with the dream. But the repressive
resistance of the ego is not abolished
<span class="pageno" id="Page_266">266</span>in sleep, but merely reduced. Some of it remains
in the shape of a <em>censorship of dreams</em>
and forbids the unconscious impulse to express
itself in the forms which it would properly
assume. In consequence of the severity
of the censorship of dreams, the latent dream-thoughts
are obliged to submit to being altered
and softened so as to make the forbidden
meaning of the dream unrecognizable. This
is the explanation of <em>dream-distortion</em>, which
accounts for the most striking characteristic
of the manifest dream. We are therefore justified
in asserting that <em>a dream is the (disguised)
fulfilment of a (repressed) wish</em>. It
will now be seen that dreams are constructed
like neurotic symptoms: they are compromises
between the demands of a repressed impulse
and the resistance of a censoring force
in the ego. Since they have a similar origin
they are equally unintelligible and stand in
equal need of interpretation.</p>

<p class="c009">There is no difficulty in discovering the
general function of dreaming. It serves the
purpose of warding off, by a kind of soothing
action, external or internal stimuli which
<span class="pageno" id="Page_267">267</span>would tend to arouse the sleeper, and thus of
securing sleep against interruption. External
stimuli are warded off by being given a new
interpretation and by being woven into some
harmless situation; internal stimuli, caused
by the pressure of instincts, are given free
play by the sleeper and allowed to find satisfaction
in the formation of dreams, so long
as the latent dream-thoughts submit to the
control of the censorship. But if they threaten
to break free and the meaning of the dream
becomes too plain, the sleeper cuts short the
dream and awakens in terror. (Dreams of
this class are known as <em>anxiety-dreams</em>). A
similar failure in the function of dreaming
occurs if an external stimulus becomes too
strong to be warded off. (This is the class of
<em>awakening-dreams</em>). I have given the name
of <em>dream-work</em> to the process which, with the
co-operation of the censorship, converts the
latent thoughts into the manifest content of
the dream. It consists in a peculiar way of
treating the preconscious material of thought,
so that its component parts become <em>condensed</em>,
its mental emphasis becomes <em>displaced</em>, and
<span class="pageno" id="Page_268">268</span>the whole of it is translated into visual images
or <em>dramatized</em>, and filled out by a deceptive
secondary elaboration. The dream-work is an
excellent example of the processes occurring
in the deeper, unconscious layers of the mind,
which differ considerably from the familiar
normal processes of thought. It also displays
a number of archaic characteristics, such as
the use of a <em>symbolism</em> (in this case of a predominantly
sexual kind) which it has since
also been possible to discover in other spheres
of mental activity.</p>

<p class="c009">We have explained that the unconscious
impulse which causes the dream connects itself
with part of the day’s residues, with some
unexhausted interest of waking life; this lends
the dream which is thus brought into being
a double value for the work of analysis. It is
true that, on the one hand, a dream that has
been analysed reveals itself as the fulfilment
of a repressed wish; but, on the other hand,
it will be a continuation of some preconscious
activity of the day before and will contain
subject-matter of some kind or other, giving
expression, for instance, to a determination, a
<span class="pageno" id="Page_269">269</span>warning, a reflection or once more to the fulfilment
of a wish. Analysis exploits the dream
in both directions as a means of obtaining
knowledge alike of the patient’s conscious
and of his unconscious processes. It also
profits from the fact that dreams have access
to the forgotten material of childhood, and
so it happens that infantile amnesia is for the
most part overcome in connection with the
interpretation of dreams. In this respect
dreams achieve a part of what was previously
the task of hypnosis. On the other hand, I
have never maintained the assertion which
has so often been ascribed to me, that dream-interpretation
shows that all dreams have a
sexual content or are derived from sexual
motive forces. It is easy to see that hunger,
thirst, or the need to excrete, can produce
dreams of satisfaction just as well as any repressed
sexual or egoistic impulse. The case
of young children affords us a convenient
test of the validity of our theory of dreams.
In them the various psychical systems are not
yet sharply divided and the repressions have
not yet grown deep, so that we often come
<span class="pageno" id="Page_270">270</span>upon dreams which are nothing more than undisguised
fulfilments of impulses left over
from waking life. Under the influence of imperative
needs, adults may also produce
dreams of this infantile type.</p>

<p class="c009">In the same way that psychoanalysis makes
use of dream-interpretation, it also profits by
the study of the numerous little slips and mistakes
which people make—symptomatic actions,
as they are called. I investigated this
subject in a series of papers which were published
for the first time in book-form in 1904
under the title of <cite>The Psychopathology of
Everyday Life</cite>.<a id="r12"></a><a class="c014 pginternal" href="#f12"><sup>[12]</sup></a> In this widely circulated
work I have pointed out that these phenomena
are not accidental, that they require
more than physiological explanations, that
they have a meaning and can be interpreted,
and that one is justified in inferring
from them the presence of restrained or repressed
impulses and intentions. But what
constitutes the enormous importance of
dream-interpretation, as well as of this latter
<span class="pageno" id="Page_271">271</span>study, is not the assistance they give to the
work of analysis but another of their qualities.
Previously psychoanalysis had only been
concerned with solving pathological phenomena
and in order to explain them it had
often been driven into making assumptions
whose comprehensiveness was out of all proportion
to the importance of the actual material
under consideration. But when it came
to dreams, it was no longer dealing with a
pathological symptom, but with a phenomenon
of normal mental life which might occur
in any healthy person. If dreams turned
out to be constructed like symptoms, if
their explanation required the same assumptions—the
repression of impulses, substitute-formation,
compromise-formation, the dividing
of the conscious and the unconscious
into various psychical systems—then psychoanalysis
was no longer a subsidiary science in
the field of psycho-pathology, it was rather the
foundation for a new and deeper science of the
mind which would be equally indispensable
for the understanding of the normal. Its postulates
<span class="pageno" id="Page_272">272</span>and findings could be carried over to
other regions of mental happening; a path lay
open to it that led far afield, into spheres of
universal interest.</p>

<p class="drop-capa0_0_6 c008">I must interrupt my account of the internal
growth of psychoanalysis and turn
to its external history. What I have so far described
of its discoveries has related for the
most part to the results of my own work; but
I have filled in my account with material
from later dates and have not distinguished
between my own contributions and those of
my pupils and followers.</p>

<p class="c009">For more than ten years after my separation
from Breuer, I had no followers. I was
completely isolated. In Vienna I was shunned,
abroad no notice was taken of me. My <cite>Interpretation
of Dreams</cite>, published in 1900, was
scarcely reviewed in the technical journals.
In my essay “On the History of the Psycho-Analytic
Movement” I mentioned, as an instance
of the attitude adopted by psychiatric
circles in Vienna, a conversation with an assistant
at the Clinic, who had written a book
<span class="pageno" id="Page_274">274</span>against my theories, but had never read my
<cite>Interpretation of Dreams</cite>. He had been told
at the Clinic that it was not worth while. The
man in question, who has since become a professor,
has gone so far as to repudiate my report
of the conversation and to throw doubts
in general upon the accuracy of my recollection.
I can only say that I stand by every word
of the account I then gave.</p>

<p class="c009">As soon as I realized the inevitable nature
of what I had come up against, my sensitiveness
greatly diminished. Moreover, my isolation
gradually came to an end. To begin with,
a small circle of pupils gathered round me
in Vienna; and then, after 1906, came the
news that the psychiatrists at Zurich, E.
Bleuler, his assistant C. G. Jung, and others,
were taking a lively interest in psychoanalysis.
We got into personal touch with one
another, and at Easter 1908, the friends of the
young science met at Salzburg, agreed upon
the regular repetition of similar informal congresses
and arranged for the publication of a
periodical which was edited by Jung and was
given the title of <i><span lang="de">Jahrbuch für psychopathologische
<span class="pageno" id="Page_275">275</span>und psychoanalytische Forschungen</span></i>.
It was brought out under the direction of
Bleuler and myself and ceased publication at
the beginning of the Great War. At the same
time that the Swiss psychiatrists joined the
movement, interest in psychoanalysis began
to be aroused all over Germany, it became the
subject of a large number of written comments
as well as of lively discussions at scientific
congresses. But its reception was nowhere
friendly or even benevolently impartial.
After the briefest acquaintance with
psychoanalysis, German science was united
in rejecting it.</p>

<p class="c009">Even today it is, of course, impossible for
me to foresee the final judgment of posterity
upon the value of psychoanalysis for psychiatry,
psychology and the mental sciences
in general. But I fancy that, when the history
of the phase we have lived through comes to
be written, German science will not have
cause to be proud of those who represented it.
I am not thinking of the fact that they rejected
psychoanalysis or of the decisive way
in which they did so; both of these things
<span class="pageno" id="Page_276">276</span>were easily intelligible, they were only to be
expected and at any rate they threw no discredit
upon the character of the opponents
of analysis. But for the degree of arrogance
which they displayed, for their conscienceless
contempt of logic, and for the coarseness
and bad taste of their attacks, there could be
no excuse. It may be said that it is childish of
me to give free rein to such feelings as these
now, after fifteen years have passed; nor
would I do so unless I had something more to
add. Years later, during the Great War, when
a chorus of enemies were bringing against the
German nation the charge of barbarism, a
charge which sums up all that I have written
above, it none the less hurt deeply to feel that
my own experience would not allow me
to contradict it.</p>

<p class="c009">One of my opponents boasted of silencing
his patients as soon as they began to talk of
anything sexual and evidently thought that
this technique gave him a right to judge the
part played by sexuality in the neuroses.
Apart from emotional resistances, which were
so easily explicable by the psychoanalytical
<span class="pageno" id="Page_277">277</span>theory that it was impossible to be misled by
them, it seemed to me that the main obstacle
to agreement lay in the fact that my opponents
regarded psychoanalysis as a product of
my speculative imagination and were unwilling
to believe in the long, patient and unbiased
work which had gone to its making.
Since, in their opinion, analysis had nothing
to do with observation or experience, they
believed that they themselves were justified in
rejecting it without experience. Others again,
who did not feel so strongly convinced of this,
repeated in their resistance the classical
manœuvre of not looking through the microscope
so as to avoid seeing what they had denied.
It is remarkable, indeed, how incorrectly
most people act when they are obliged
to form a judgment of their own upon some
new subject. I have heard for years from
“benevolent” critics—and I am told the same
thing even today—that psychoanalysis is
right up to such-and-such a point, but that
there it begins to exaggerate and to generalize
without justification. But I know that, while
nothing is more difficult than to draw such a
<span class="pageno" id="Page_278">278</span>line, only a few weeks or days earlier the
critic has been completely ignorant of the
whole subject.</p>

<p class="c009">The result of the official anathema against
psychoanalysis was that the analysts began
to come closer together. At the second Congress,
held at Nuremberg in 1910, they
formed themselves, on the proposal of S.
Ferenczi, into an “International Psycho-Analytical
Association,” divided into a number
of local societies, but under a common
president. The Association survived the Great
War and still exists, consisting today of
branch societies in Austria, Germany, Hungary,
Switzerland, Great Britain, Holland,
Russia and India as well as two in the United
States.<a id="r13"></a><a class="c014 pginternal" href="#f13"><sup>[13]</sup></a> I arranged that C. G. Jung should be
appointed as the first President, which turned
out later to have been a most unfortunate step.
At the same time a second journal devoted to
psychoanalysis was started, the <cite><span lang="de">Zentralblatt
für Psychoanalyse</span></cite>, edited by Adler and Stekel,
and a little later a third, <cite>Imago</cite>, edited
<span class="pageno" id="Page_279">279</span>by two non-medical analysts, H. Sachs and
O. Rank, and intended to deal with the application
of analysis to the mental sciences.
Soon afterwards Bleuler published a paper in
defence of psychoanalysis.<a id="r14"></a><a class="c014 pginternal" href="#f14"><sup>[14]</sup></a> Though it was
a relief to find honesty and straight-forward
logic for once taking part in the dispute yet
I could not feel completely satisfied by Bleuler’s
essay. He strove too eagerly after an
appearance of impartiality; nor is it a matter
of chance that it is to him that our science
owes the valuable concept of <em>ambivalence</em>. In
later papers Bleuler adopted such a critical
attitude towards the theoretical structure of
analysis and rejected or threw doubts upon
such essential parts of it, that I could not help
asking myself in astonishment what could be
left of it for him to admire. Yet not only has
he subsequently uttered the strongest pleas in
favor of “depth psychology,” but he based his
comprehensive study of schizophrenia upon
it. Nevertheless Bleuler did not for long remain
a member of the International Psycho-Analytical
<span class="pageno" id="Page_280">280</span>Association; he resigned from it
as a result of misunderstandings with Jung,
and the Burghölzli<a id="r15"></a><a class="c014 pginternal" href="#f15"><sup>[15]</sup></a> was lost to analysis.</p>

<p class="c009">Official disapproval could not hinder the
spread of psychoanalysis either in Germany
or in other countries. I have elsewhere<a id="r16"></a><a class="c014 pginternal" href="#f16"><sup>[16]</sup></a> followed
the stages of its growth and given the
names of those who were its first representatives.
In 1909 G. Stanley Hall invited Jung
and me to America to go to the Clark University,
Worcester, Mass., of which he was
President, and to spend a week giving lectures
(in German) at the celebration of the
twentieth anniversary of that body’s foundation.
Hall was justly esteemed as a psychologist
and educationalist, and had introduced
psychoanalysis into his courses some years before;
there was a touch of the “king-maker”
about him, a pleasure in setting up authorities
and in then deposing them. We also met
James J. Putnam there, the Harvard neurologist,
who, in spite of his age, was an enthusiastic
supporter of psychoanalysis and threw
<span class="pageno" id="Page_281">281</span>the whole weight of a personality that was
universally respected into the defence of the
cultural value of analysis and the purity of
its aims. He was an estimable man, in whom,
as a reaction against a predisposition to obsessional
neurosis, an ethical bias predominated;
and the only thing in him that we
could regret was his inclination to attach
psychoanalysis to a particular philosophical
system and to make it the servant of moral
aims. Another event of this time, which made
a lasting impression upon me, was a meeting
with William James, the philosopher. I shall
never forget one little scene that occurred as
we were on a walk together. He stopped suddenly,
handed me a bag he was carrying and
asked me to walk on, saying that he would
catch me up as soon as he had got through an
attack of angina pectoris which was just coming
on. He died of that disease a year later;
and I have always wished that I might be as
fearless as he was in the face of approaching
death.</p>

<p class="c009">At that time I was only 53, I felt young and
healthy, and my short visit to the new world
<span class="pageno" id="Page_282">282</span>encouraged my self-respect in every way. In
Europe I felt as though I were despised; but
over there I found myself received by the
foremost men as an equal. As I stepped onto
the platform at Worcester to deliver my <cite>Five
Lectures upon Psycho-Analysis</cite>, it seemed like
the realization of some incredible day-dream:
psychoanalysis was no longer a product of
delusion, it had become a valuable part of
reality. It has not lost ground in America
since our visit; it is extremely popular among
the lay public and is recognized by a number
of official psychiatrists as an important element
in medical training. Unfortunately,
however, it has suffered a great deal from being
watered down. Moreover, many abuses
which have no relation to it find a cover under
its name, and there are few opportunities
for any thorough training in technique or
theory. In America, too, it has come in conflict
with Behaviorism, a theory which is
naïve enough to boast that it has put the whole
problem of psychology completely out of
court.</p>

<p class="c009">In Europe, during the years 1911–1913,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_283">283</span>two secessionist movements from psychoanalysis
took place, led by men who had previously
played a considerable part in the
young science, Alfred Adler and C. G. Jung.
Both movements seemed most threatening
and quickly obtained a large following. But
their strength lay, not in their own content,
but in the temptation which they offered of
being freed from what were felt as the repellent
findings of psychoanalysis without
the necessity of rejecting its actual material.
Jung attempted to give to the facts of analysis
a fresh interpretation of an abstract,
impersonal and non-historical character, and
thus hoped to escape the need for recognizing
the importance of infantile sexuality and of
the Œdipus complex, as well as the necessity
for any analysis of childhood. Adler seemed to
depart still further from psychoanalysis; he
entirely repudiated the importance of sexuality,
traced back the formation both of
character and of the neuroses solely to men’s
desire for power and to their need to compensate
for their constitutional inferiority,
and threw all the psychological discoveries of
<span class="pageno" id="Page_284">284</span>psychoanalysis to the winds. But what he had
rejected forced its way back into his closed
system under other names; his “masculine
protest” is nothing else than repression unjustifiably
sexualized. The criticism with which
the two heretics were met was a mild one; I
only insisted that both Adler and Jung should
cease to describe their theories as “psychoanalysis.”
After a lapse of ten years, it can be
asserted that both of these attempts against
psychoanalysis have blown over without doing
any harm.</p>

<p class="c009">If a community is based on agreement upon
a few cardinal points, it is obvious that people
who have abandoned that common
ground will cease to belong to it. Yet the
secession of former pupils has often been
brought up against me as a sign of my intolerance
or has been regarded as evidence of
some special fatality that hangs over me. It
is a sufficient answer to point out that, in contrast
to those who have left me, like Jung, Adler,
Stekel and a few besides, there are a great
number of men, like Abraham, Eitingon, Ferenczi,
Rank, Jones, Brill, Sachs, Pfister, van
<span class="pageno" id="Page_285">285</span>Emden, Reik and others who have worked
with me for some fifteen years in loyal collaboration
and for the most part in uninterrupted
friendship. I have only mentioned the
oldest of my pupils who have already made a
distinguished name for themselves in the
literature of psychoanalysis; if I have passed
over others, that is not to be taken as a slight,
and indeed among those who are young and
have joined me lately, talents are to be found
on which great hopes may be set. But I think
I can say in my defence that an intolerant
man, dominated by an arrogant belief in his
own infallibility, would never have been able
to maintain his hold upon so large a number
of intelligent people, especially if he had at
his command as few practical attractions as
I had.</p>

<p class="c009">The Great War, which broke up so many
other organizations, could do nothing against
our “International.” The first meeting after
the war took place in 1920 at the Hague on
neutral ground. It was moving to see how hospitably
the Dutch welcomed the starving and
impoverished subjects of the Central European
<span class="pageno" id="Page_286">286</span>states; and I believe this was the first
occasion in a ruined world on which Englishmen
and Germans sat at the same table for
the friendly discussion of scientific interests.
Both in Germany and in the countries of
Western Europe, the war had actually stimulated
interest in psychoanalysis. The observation
of war neuroses had at last opened the
eyes of the medical profession to the importance
of psycho-genesis in neurotic disturbances,
and some of our psychological
conceptions, such as the “advantage of being
ill” and the “flight into illness,” suddenly became
popular. The last Congress before the
German collapse, which was held at Budapest
in 1918, was attended by official representatives
of the allied governments of the
Central European powers, and they agreed to
the establishment of psychoanalytic stations
for the treatment of war neuroses. But this
point was never reached. Similarly, too, the
comprehensive plans made by one of our leading
members, Dr. Anton von Freund, for
establishing in Budapest a centre for analytic
study and treatment came to grief as a result
<span class="pageno" id="Page_287">287</span>of the political disorders of the time and of
the premature death of their generous author.
At a later date some of his ideas were put
into execution by Max Eitingon, who, in
1920, founded a psychoanalytical clinic in
Berlin. During the brief period of Bolshevist
rule in Hungary, Ferenczi was able to carry
on a successful course of instruction as the
official representative of psychoanalysis at the
University of Budapest. After the war, our
opponents announced with great joy that
events had produced a conclusive argument
against the validity of the theses of analysis.
The war neuroses, they said, had proved that
sexual factors were unnecessary to the ætiology
of neurotic disorders. But their triumph
was frivolous and premature. For, on the
one hand, no one had been able to carry
out a thorough analysis of a case of war neurosis,
so that, in fact, nothing whatever was
known for certain as to their motivation and
no conclusions could be drawn from this uncertainty.
While, on the other hand, psychoanalysis
had long before arrived at the concept
of narcissism and of narcissistic neuroses,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_288">288</span>in which the subject’s libido is attached
to his own ego instead of to an object.
Though, on other occasions, therefore, the
charge was brought against psychoanalysis
of having made an unjustifiable extension of
the concept of sexuality, yet, when it became
convenient for polemical ends, this crime was
forgotten and we were once more held down
to the narrowest meaning of the word.</p>

<p class="c009">If the preliminary cathartic period is left
on one side, the history of psychoanalysis
falls, from my point of view, into two phases.
In the first of these, I stood alone and had to
do all the work myself: this was from 1895–96
until 1906 or 1907. In the second phase,
lasting from then until the present time, the
contributions of my pupils and collaborators
have been growing more and more in importance,
so that today, when a grave illness
warns me of the approaching end, I can think
with a quiet mind of the cessation of my own
labors. For that very reason, however, it is
impossible for me in this <cite>Autobiographical
Study</cite> to deal as fully with the progress of
psychoanalysis during the second phase as I
<span class="pageno" id="Page_289">289</span>did with its gradual rise during the first
phase, which was concerned with my own activity
alone. I feel that I should only be justified
in mentioning here those new discoveries
in which I still played a prominent part—in
particular, therefore, those made in the
sphere of narcissism, of the theory of the instincts,
and of the application of psychoanalysis
to the psychoses.</p>

<p class="c009">I must begin by saying that increasing experience
showed more and more plainly that
the Œdipus complex was the nucleus of the
neuroses. It was at once the climax of infantile
sexual life and the point of junction
from which all of its later developments proceeded.
But if so, it was no longer possible to
expect analysis to discover a factor that was
specific in the ætiology of the neuroses. It
must be true, as Jung expressed it so well in
the early days when he was still an analyst,
that neuroses have no peculiar content which
belongs exclusively to them, but that neurotics
break down at the same difficulties that
are successfully overcome by normal people.
This discovery was very far from being a disappointment.
<span class="pageno" id="Page_290">290</span>It was in complete harmony
with another one: that the depth psychology
revealed by psychoanalysis was in fact the
psychology of the normal mind. Our path had
been like that of chemistry: the great qualitative
differences between substances were
traced back to quantitative variations in the
proportions in which the same elements were
combined.</p>

<p class="c009">In the Œdipus complex, the libido is attached
to the image of the parents. But earlier
there has been a period in which there were
no such objects. There followed from this fact
the concept (of fundamental importance for
the libido theory) of a state in which the subject’s
libido fills his own ego and has that
for its object. This state could be called <em>narcissism</em>
or self-love. A moment’s reflection
showed that this state never completely ceases.
All through the subject’s life his ego remains
the great reservoir of his libido, from which
the attachments to objects (the <em>objectcathexes</em><a id="r17"></a><a class="c014 pginternal" href="#f17"><sup>[17]</sup></a>)
radiate out and into which the libido
can stream back again from the objects. Thus
<span class="pageno" id="Page_291">291</span>narcissistic libido is constantly being converted
into object-libido, and <em>vice versa</em>. An
excellent instance of the length to which this
conversion can go is afforded by the sexual or
sublimated devotion which involves a sacrifice
of the self. Whereas, hitherto, in considering
the process of repression, attention had
only been paid to what was repressed, these
ideas made it also possible to form a correct
estimate of the repressing forces. It had been
said that repression was set in action by the
instincts of self-preservation operating in the
ego (the “ego-instincts”), and that it was
brought to bear upon the libidinal instincts.
But since the instincts of self-preservation
were now recognized as also being of a libidinal
nature, as being narcissistic libido, the
process of repression was seen to be a process
occurring within the libido itself; narcissistic
libido was opposed to object-libido,
the interests of self-preservation defended
themselves against the demands of object-love,
that is, against the demands of sexuality in the
narrower sense.</p>

<p class="c009">There is no more urgent need in psychology
<span class="pageno" id="Page_292">292</span>than for a securely founded theory of the instincts
on which it might then be possible to
build further. Nothing of the sort exists, however,
and psychoanalysis is driven to making
tentative efforts towards some such theory. It
began by drawing a contrast between the ego-instincts
(the instinct of self-preservation,
hunger) and the libidinal instincts (love),
but later replaced it by a new contrast between
narcissistic and object-libido. This was
clearly not the last word on the subject;
biological considerations seemed to make it
impossible to remain content with assuming
the existence of only a single class of instincts.</p>

<p class="c009">In the works of my later years (<cite>Beyond
the Pleasure Principle</cite>, <cite>Group Psychology
and the Analysis of the Ego</cite>, and <cite>The Ego and
the Id</cite>)<a id="r18"></a><a class="c014 pginternal" href="#f18"><sup>[18]</sup></a> I have given free rein to the inclination
to speculation which I kept down for
so long and I have also taken stock of a new
solution of the problem of the instincts. I have
combined the instincts for self-preservation
and for the preservation of the species under
<span class="pageno" id="Page_293">293</span>the concept of <cite>Eros</cite> and have contrasted with
it an instinct of death or destruction which
works in silence. Instinct, in general, is regarded
as a kind of elasticity of living things,
an impulsion towards the restoration of a situation
which once existed but was brought to
an end by some external disturbance. This
essentially conservative character of instincts
is exemplified by the phenomena of the <em>compulsion
to repeat</em>. The picture which life
presents to us is the result of the working of
Eros and the death-instinct together and
against each other.</p>

<p class="c009">It remains to be seen whether this construction
will turn out to be serviceable. Although
it arose from a desire to fix some of the
most important theoretical ideas of psychoanalysis,
it goes far beyond psychoanalysis.
I have repeatedly heard it said contemptuously
that it is impossible to take a science
seriously whose most general concepts are
as lacking in precision as those of libido and
of instinct in psychoanalysis. But this reproach
is based upon a complete misconception of the
facts. Clear fundamental concepts and sharply
<span class="pageno" id="Page_294">294</span>drawn definitions are only possible in the mental
sciences in so far as the latter seek to fit a
department of facts into the frame of a logical
system. In the natural sciences, of which psychology
is one, such clearcut general concepts
are superfluous and indeed impossible. Zoology
and Botany did not start from correct
and adequate definitions of an animal and a
plant; to this very day Biology has been unable
to give any certain meaning to the concept
of life. Physics itself, indeed, would
never have made any advance if it had had to
wait until its concepts of matter, force, gravitation,
and so on, had reached the desirable degree
of clarity and precision. The fundamental
concepts or most general ideas in any of the
disciplines of science are always left indeterminate
at first and are only explained to begin
with by reference to the realm of phenomena
from which they were derived; it is only by
means of a progressive analysis of the material
of observation that they can be made clear
and can find a significant and consistent meaning.</p>

<p class="c009">I had already made attempts at earlier
<span class="pageno" id="Page_295">295</span>stages of my work to arrive at some more general
points of view, starting from the observations
of psychoanalysis. In a short essay,
“Formulations regarding the Two Principles
of Mental Functioning,”<a id="r19"></a><a class="c014 pginternal" href="#f19"><sup>[19]</sup></a> published in 1911,
I drew attention (and there was, of course,
nothing original in this), to the domination
of the “pleasure-pain principle” in mental life
and to its displacement by the so-called “reality
principle.” Later on (1915–17), I made
an attempt to produce a “Metapsychology.”
By this I meant a method of approach according
to which every mental process is considered
in relation to three coördinates,
which I described as <em>dynamic</em>, <em>topographical</em>,
and <em>economic</em> respectively; and this seemed to
me to represent the farthest goal that psychology
could attain. The attempt remained
no more than a torso; after writing two or
three papers—“Instincts and their Vicissitudes,”
“Repression,” “The Unconscious,”
“Mourning and Melancholia,” etc<a id="r20"></a><a class="c014 pginternal" href="#f20"><sup>[20]</sup></a>—I broke
<span class="pageno" id="Page_296">296</span>off, wisely perhaps, since the time for
theoretical predictions of this kind had not
yet come. In my latest speculative works I
have set about the task of dissecting our mental
apparatus on the basis of the analytic view
of pathological facts and have divided it into
an <em>ego</em>, and <em>id</em>, and a <em>super-ego</em>.<a id="r21"></a><a class="c014 pginternal" href="#f21"><sup>[21]</sup></a> The super-ego
is the heir of the Œdipus complex and
represents the ethical standards of mankind.</p>

<p class="c009">I should not like to create an impression
that during this last period of my work I have
turned my back upon patient observation and
have abandoned myself entirely to speculation.
I have, on the contrary, always remained
in the closest touch with the analytic material
and have never ceased working at detailed
points of clinical or technical importance.
Even when I have moved away from observation,
I have carefully avoided any contact
with philosophy proper. This avoidance has
been greatly facilitated by constitutional incapacity.
I was always open to the ideas of
G. T. Fechner and have followed that thinker
<span class="pageno" id="Page_297">297</span>upon many important points. The large extent
to which psychoanalysis coincides with
the philosophy of Schopenhauer—not only
did he assert the dominance of the emotions
and the supreme importance of sexuality, but
he was even aware of the mechanism of repression—is
not to be traced to my acquaintance
with his teaching. I read Schopenhauer
very late in my life. Nietzsche, another philosopher
whose guesses and intuitions often
agree in the most astonishing way with the laborious
findings of psychoanalysis, was, for a
long time, avoided by me on that very account;
I was less concerned with the question
of priority than with keeping my mind unembarrassed.</p>

<p class="c009">The neuroses were the first subject of analysis
and for a long time they were the only
one. No analyst could doubt that medical
practice was wrong in separating those disorders
from the psychoses and in attaching
them to the organic nervous diseases. The
theory of the neuroses belongs to psychiatry
and is indispensable as an introduction to it.
It would seem, however, that the analytical
<span class="pageno" id="Page_298">298</span>study of the psychoses is impracticable owing
to its lack of therapeutic results. Mental patients
are, as a rule, without the capacity for
forming a positive transference, so that the
principal instrument of analytic technique is
inapplicable to them. There are, nevertheless,
a number of methods of approach to be found.
Transference is often not so completely absent
but that it can be used to a certain extent;
and analysis has achieved undoubted successes
with cyclical depressions, light paranoic
modifications and partial schizophrenias.
It has at least been a benefit to science that
in many cases the diagnosis can oscillate for
quite a long time between assuming the presence
of a psychoneurosis or of a dementia
præcox; for therapeutic attempts initiated in
such cases have resulted in valuable discoveries
before they have had to be broken off. But
the chief consideration in this connection is
that so many things that, in the neuroses, have
to be laboriously fetched up from the depths,
are found in the psychoses upon the surface,
visible to every eye. So that the best subjects
for the demonstration of many of the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_299">299</span>assertions of analysis are provided by the
psychiatric clinic. It was thus bound to happen
before long that analysis would find its
way to the objects of psychiatric observation.
At a very early date (1896) I was able to
establish, in a case of paranoid dementia, the
presence of the same ætiological factors and
the same emotional complexes as in the neuroses.
Jung explained some most puzzling
stereotypes in dements by bringing them into
relation with the patients’ life histories; Bleuler
demonstrated the existence in various
psychoses of mechanisms like those which
analysis had discovered in neurotics. Since
then analysts have never relaxed their efforts
to come to an understanding of the psychoses.
Especially since it has been possible to work
with the concept of narcissism, they have
managed, now in this place and now in that,
to get a glimpse beyond the wall. Most of all,
no doubt, was achieved by Abraham in his
elucidation of melancholia. It is true that in
this sphere all our knowledge is not yet converted
into therapeutic power; but the mere
theoretical gain is not to be despised, and we
<span class="pageno" id="Page_300">300</span>may be content to wait for its practical application.
In the long run even the psychiatrists
have been unable to resist the convincing
force of their own clinical material. At the
present time German psychiatry is undergoing
a kind of “peaceful penetration” by analytic
views. While they continually declare
that they will never be psychoanalysts, that
they do not belong to the “orthodox” school
or agree with its exaggerations, and in particular
that they do not believe in the predominance
of the sexual factor, nevertheless
the majority of the younger workers take over
one piece or another of analytic theory and
apply it in their own fashion to the material.
All the signs point to the proximity of further
developments in the same direction.</p>

<p class="drop-capa0_0_6 c008">I now watch from a distance the symptomatic
reactions that are accompanying
the introduction of psychoanalysis into the
France which was for so long refractory. It
seems like a reproduction of something I
have lived through before, and yet it has
peculiarities of its own. Objections of incredible
simplicity are raised, such as that French
sensitiveness is offended by the pedantry
and crudity of psychoanalytical terminology.
(One cannot help being reminded of Lessing’s
immortal Chevalier Riccaut de la Marlinière.<a id="r22"></a><a class="c014 pginternal" href="#f22"><sup>[22]</sup></a>)
Another comment has a more serious
ring (a Professor of Psychology at the
Sorbonne did not think it beneath him): the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_302">302</span>whole method of thought of psychoanalysis
is inconsistent with the <em>génie latin</em>. Here the
Anglo-Saxon allies of France, who count as
supporters of analysis, are explicitly thrown
over. Anyone hearing such words would suppose
that psychoanalysis had been the favourite
child of the <em>génie teutonique</em> and had
been clasped to its heart from the moment of
birth.</p>

<p class="c009">In France the interest in psychoanalysis
began among the men of letters. To understand
this, it must be borne in mind that from
the time of the writing of <cite>The Interpretation
of Dreams</cite>, psychoanalysis ceased to be a
purely medical subject. Between its appearance
in Germany and in France lies the history
of its numerous applications to departments
of literature and of æsthetics, to the history
of religions and to pre-history, to my
theology, to folk-lore, to education, and so on.
None of these things have much to do with
medicine; in fact it is only through psychoanalysis
that they are connected with it. I have
no business, therefore, to go into them in detail
<span class="pageno" id="Page_303">303</span>in these pages.<a id="r23"></a><a class="c014 pginternal" href="#f23"><sup>[23]</sup></a> I cannot pass them over
completely in silence, however, for, on the one
hand, they are essential to a correct appreciation
of the nature and value of psychoanalysis,
and, on the other hand, I have, after
all, undertaken to give an account of my lifework.
The beginnings of the majority of these
applications of psychoanalysis will be found
in my works. Here and there I have gone a
little way along the path in order to gratify
my non-medical interests. Later on, others
(not only doctors, but specialists in the various
fields as well) have followed in my tracks
and penetrated far into the different subjects.
But since my programme limits me to a mention
of my own share in these applications of
psychoanalysis, I can only give a quite inadequate
picture of their extent and importance.</p>

<p class="c009">A number of suggestions came to me out of
the Œdipus complex, the ubiquity of which
gradually dawned on me. The poet’s choice,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_304">304</span>or his invention, of such a terrible subject
seemed puzzling; and so, too, did the overwhelming
effect of its dramatic treatment,
and the general nature of such tragedies of
destiny. But all of this became intelligible
when one realized that a universal law of
mental life had here been captured in all its
emotional significance. Fate and the oracle
were no more than materializations of an internal
necessity; and the fact of the hero sinning
without his knowledge and against his
intentions was evidently a right expression of
the <em>unconscious</em> nature of his criminal tendencies.
From understanding this tragedy of
destiny it was only a step further to understanding
a tragedy of character—<cite>Hamlet</cite>,
which had been admired for 300 years without
its meaning being discovered or its author’s
motives guessed. It could scarcely be
a chance that this neurotic creation of the poet
should have broken down, like his numberless
fellows in the real world, at the Œdipus complex;
for Hamlet was faced with the task of
taking vengeance upon another for the two
deeds which are the subject of the Œdipus desires,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_305">305</span>and before that task his arm was paralysed
by his own obscure sense of guilt.
Shakespeare wrote <cite>Hamlet</cite> very soon after
his father’s death. The suggestions made by
me for the analysis of this tragedy were fully
worked out later on by Ernest Jones. And the
same example was afterwards used by Otto
Rank as the starting-point for his investigation
of the choice of material made by dramatists.
In his large volume upon the incest
theme<a id="r24"></a><a class="c014 pginternal" href="#f24"><sup>[24]</sup></a> he was able to show how often imaginative
writers have taken as their subject the
themes of the Œdipus situation, and traced in
the different literatures of the world the way
in which the material has been transformed,
modified and softened.</p>

<p class="c009">It was tempting to go on from there to an
attempt at an analysis of poetic and artistic
creation in general. The realm of imagination
was evidently a “sanctuary” made during the
painful transition from the pleasure principle
to the reality principle in order to provide a
substitute for the gratification of instincts
which had to be given up in real life. The artist,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_306">306</span>like the neurotic, had withdrawn from
an unsatisfying reality into this world of
imagination, but, unlike the neurotic, he knew
how to find a way back from it and once more
to get a firm foothold in reality. His creations,
works of art, were the imaginary gratifications
of unconscious wishes, just as dreams
are; and like them, they were in the nature of
compromises, since they too were obliged to
avoid any open conflict with the forces of repression.
But they differed from the asocial,
narcissistic products of dreaming in that they
were calculated to arouse interest in other
people and were able to evoke and to gratify
the same unconscious wishes in them too. Besides
this, they have made use of the perceptual
pleasure of formal beauty as what I
have called an “incitement-premium.” What
psychoanalysis was able to do was to take
the inter-relations between the impressions of
the artist’s life, his chance experiences and
his works, and from them to construct his constitution
and the impulses at work in it—that
is to say, that part of him which he shared
<span class="pageno" id="Page_307">307</span>with all men. With this aim in view, for instance,
I made Leonardo da Vinci the subject
of a study which is based upon a single
memory of childhood related by him and
which aims chiefly at explaining his picture
of “St. Anne with the Virgin and Child.” It
does not appear that the enjoyment of a work
of art is spoiled by the knowledge gained
from such an analysis. The layman may perhaps
expect too much from analysis in this
field, for it must be admitted that it throws
no light upon the two problems which probably
interest him the most. It can do nothing
towards elucidating the nature of the artistic
gift, nor can it explain the means by which
the artist works—artistic technique.</p>

<p class="c009">I was able to show from a short story by
W. Jensen called <cite>Gradiva</cite>, which has no particular
merit in itself, that invented dreams
can be interpreted in the same way as real
ones and that the unconscious mechanisms
familiar to us in the “dream-work” are thus
also operative in the processes of imaginative
writing.</p>

<p class="c009"><span class="pageno" id="Page_308">308</span>My book upon <cite>Wit and its Relation to the
Unconscious</cite><a id="r25"></a><a class="c014 pginternal" href="#f25"><sup>[25]</sup></a> was a side-issue, indirectly derived
from <cite>The Interpretation of Dreams</cite>.
The only friend of mine who was at that time
interested in my work remarked to me that
my interpretations of dreams often impressed
him as being like jokes. In order to throw
some light on this impression, I began to investigate
jokes and found that their essence
lay in the technical methods employed in
them, and that these were the same as the
means used in the “dream-work”—that is to
say, condensation, displacement, the representation
of a thing by its opposite or by a
triviality, and so on. This led to an economic
enquiry as to the origin of the high degree of
pleasure obtained from hearing a joke. And
to this the answer was that it was due to the
momentary suspension of the energy expended
upon maintaining repression owing to the attraction
exercised by the offer of a premium
of pleasure (“fore-pleasure”).</p>

<p class="c009">I myself set a higher value upon my contributions
<span class="pageno" id="Page_309">309</span>to the psychology of religion, which
began in 1907 with the establishment of a remarkable
similarity between obsessive acts
and religious practices or ritual. Without as
yet understanding the deeper connections, I
described the obsessional neurosis as a distorted
private religion and religion as a kind
of universal obsessional neurosis. Later on, in
1912, the explicit indications of Jung as to the
far-reaching analogies between the mental
products of neurotics and of primitive peoples,
led me to turn my attention to that subject.
In four essays, which were collected into
a book with the title of <cite>Totem and Taboo</cite>,<a id="r26"></a><a class="c014 pginternal" href="#f26"><sup>[26]</sup></a> I
showed that the dread of incest was even more
marked among primitive than among civilized
races and had given rise to very special
measures of defence against it; I examined
the relations between taboo prohibitions (the
earliest form in which moral restrictions
make their appearance) and emotional ambivalence;
and I discovered under the primitive
scheme of the universe, known as animism,
the principle of the over-estimation of
<span class="pageno" id="Page_310">310</span>the importance of psychical reality, the
principle of “the omnipotence of thoughts,”
which also lies at the root of magic. I developed
the comparison with the obsessional
neurosis at every point, and showed how
many of the postulates of primitive mental
life are still in force in that remarkable disorder.
Above all, however, I was attracted by
totemism, the first system of organization in
primitive tribes, a system in which the beginnings
of social order are united with a rudimentary
religion and the implacable domination
of a small number of taboo prohibitions.
The being that is honored is ultimately always
an animal, from which the clan also
claims to be descended. Many indications
pointed to the conclusion that every race, even
the most highly developed, had once passed
through the stage of totemism.</p>

<p class="c009">The chief literary sources of my studies in
this field were the well known works of J. G.
Frazer (<cite>Totemism and Exogamy</cite> and <cite>The
Golden Bough</cite>), a mine of valuable facts
and opinions. But Frazer effected little towards
elucidating the problems of totemism;
<span class="pageno" id="Page_311">311</span>he had more than once fundamentally altered
his views on the subject, and the other ethnologists
and prehistorians seemed in equal
uncertainty and disagreement. My starting-point
was the striking correspondence between
the two taboo-injunctions of totemism
(not to kill the totem and not to have sexual
relations with any woman of the same totem-clan)
and the two elements of the Œdipus
complex (killing the father and taking the
mother to wife). I was therefore tempted to
equate the totem animal with the father;
and, in fact, primitive peoples themselves
do this explicitly, by honouring it as the forefather
of the clan. There next came to my
help two facts from psychoanalysis, a lucky
observation of a child made by Ferenczi,
which made it possible to speak of an “infantile
return of totemism,” and the analysis of
early animal-phobias in children, which so
often showed that the animal was a substitute
for the father, a substitute onto which the fear
of the father derived from the Œdipus complex
had been displaced. Not much was lacking
to enable me to recognize the killing of
<span class="pageno" id="Page_312">312</span>the father as the nucleus of totemism and the
starting-point in the formation of religion.</p>

<p class="c009">This missing element was supplied when
I became acquainted with W. Robertson
Smith’s work, <cite>The Religion of the Semites</cite>.
Its author (a man of genius, who was both a
physicist and a biblical expert) introduced
the so-called totem-feast as an essential part
of the totemistic religion. Once a year the totem
animal, which was at other times regarded
as sacred, was solemnly killed in the
presence of all the members of the clan, was
devoured and was then mourned over. The
mourning was followed by a great festival.
When I further took into account Darwin’s
conjecture that men originally lived in hordes,
each under the domination of a single, powerful,
violent and jealous male, there rose before
me, out of all these components, the following
hypothesis, or, I would rather say, vision.
The father of the primal horde, since he was
an unlimited despot, had seized all the women
for himself; his sons, being dangerous to him
as rivals, had been killed or driven away. One
day, however, the sons came together and
<span class="pageno" id="Page_313">313</span>united to overwhelm, kill and devour their
father, who had been their enemy, but also
their ideal. After the deed, they were unable
to take over their heritage since they stood in
one another’s way. Under the influence of
failure and regret, they learned to come to
an agreement among themselves, they banded
themselves into a clan of brothers by the help
of the ordinances of totemism, which aimed
at preventing a repetition of such a deed, and
they jointly undertook to forego the possession
of the women on whose account they had
killed their father. They were then driven to
finding strange women, and this was the
origin of the exogamy which is so closely
bound up with totemism. The totem-feast was
the commemoration of the fearful deed, from
which sprang man’s sense of guilt (or
“original sin”) and which was the beginning
at once of social organization, of religion,
and of ethical restrictions.</p>

<p class="c009">Now, whether we suppose that such a possibility
was a historical event or not, it brings
the formation of religion within the circle of
the father-complex and bases it upon the ambivalence
<span class="pageno" id="Page_314">314</span>which dominates that complex.
After the totem animal had ceased to serve
as a substitute for him, the primal father, at
once feared and hated, honoured and envied,
became the prototype of God himself. The
son’s rebelliousness and his affection for his
father struggled against each other through a
constant succession of compromises, which
sought, on the one hand, to atone for the act
of parricide, and, on the other, to consolidate
the advantages it had brought. This view of
religion throws a particularly clear light
upon the psychological basis of Christianity,
in which, it may be added, the ceremony of
the totem-feast still survives, with but little
distortion, in the form of Communion. I
should like explicitly to mention that this last
observation was not made by me, but is to be
found in the works of Robertson Smith and
Frazer.</p>

<p class="c009">Theodor Reik and G. Róheim, the ethnologist,
have taken up the line of thought
which I developed in <cite>Totem and Taboo</cite>, and,
in a series of important works, have extended
it, amplified it or corrected it. I myself have
<span class="pageno" id="Page_315">315</span>since returned to it more than once in the
course of my investigations into the “unconscious
sense of guilt” (which also plays such
an important part among the motives of
neurotic suffering) and in my attempts at
forming a closer connection between social
psychology and the psychology of the individual.<a id="r27"></a><a class="c014 pginternal" href="#f27"><sup>[27]</sup></a>
I have, moreover, made use of the
idea of an archaic inheritance from the “primal
horde” epoch of mankind’s development
in explaining susceptibility to hypnosis.</p>

<p class="c009">I have taken but little direct part in certain
other applications of psychoanalysis,
though they are none the less of general interest.
It is only a step from the phantasies of
individual neurotics to the imaginative creations
of groups and peoples as we find them
in myths, legends and fairy tales. Mythology
became the special province of Otto Rank;
the interpretation of myths, the tracing of
them back to the familiar unconscious complexes
of infancy, the replacing of astral explanations
by a discovery of human motives,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_316">316</span>all of this is to a large extent due to his analytic
efforts. The subject of symbolism has
also found many students among my followers.
Symbolism has brought psychoanalysis
many enemies; many enquirers with unduly
prosaic minds have never been able to forgive
it the recognition of symbolism, which
followed from the interpretation of dreams.
But analysis is guiltless of the discovery of
symbolism, for it had long been known in
other regions of thought (such as folk-lore,
legends and myths) and plays even a larger
part in them than in the “language of
dreams.”</p>

<p class="c009">I myself have contributed nothing to the
application of analysis to education. It was
natural, however, that the analytic discoveries
as to the sexual life and mental development
of children should attract the attention
of educators and make them see their problems
in a new light. Dr. Oskar Pfister, a protestant
pastor at Zurich, led the way as a
tireless pioneer along these lines, nor did he
find the practice of analysis incompatible with
the retention of his religion, though it is true
<span class="pageno" id="Page_317">317</span>that this was of a sublimated kind. Among
the many others who worked alongside of
him, I may mention Frau Dr. Hug-Hellmuth
and Dr. S. Bernfeld, both of Vienna. The
application of analysis to the prophylactic
education of healthy children and to the
correcting of those who, though not actually
neurotic, have deviated from the normal
course of development, has led to one consequence
which is of practical importance. It
is no longer possible to restrict the practice
of psychoanalysis to physicians and to exclude
laymen from it. In fact, a physician who
has not been through a special training is, in
spite of his diploma, a layman in analysis, and
a non-physician who has been suitably trained
can, with occasional reference to a physician,
even carry out the analytic treatment of
neuroses.</p>

<p class="c009">By a process of development against which
it would have been useless to struggle, the
word “psychoanalysis” has itself become ambiguous.
While it was originally the name of
a particular therapeutic method, it has now
also become the name of a science—the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_318">318</span>science of unconscious mental processes. By
itself this science is seldom able to deal with
a problem completely, but it seems destined
to give important contributory help in a large
number of regions of knowledge. The sphere
of application of psychoanalysis extends as
far as that of psychology, to which it forms a
complement of the greatest moment.</p>

<p class="c009">Looking back, then, over the patch-work
of my life’s labours, I can say that I have
made many beginnings and thrown out many
suggestions. Something will come of them in
the future. But I cannot tell myself whether
it will be much or little.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG™
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away—you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

<h2 id="pg-footer-heading">THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE</h2>

<div class="agate">PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK
</div><div>
To protect the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg”), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg™ License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg™
electronic works
</div><div>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg™
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg™ electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div><div>
1.B. “Project Gutenberg” is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg™
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div><div>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the
Foundation” or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div><div>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div><div>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div><div>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg™ License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg™ work (any work
on which the phrase “Project Gutenberg” appears, or with which the
phrase “Project Gutenberg” is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div><blockquote><div>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div></blockquote><div>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg” associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg™
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div><div>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg™ License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.
</div><div>
1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg™
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg™.
</div><div>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg™ License.
</div><div>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg™ work in a format
other than “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg™ website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original “Plain
Vanilla ASCII” or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg™ License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div><div>
1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg™ works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div><div>
1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
provided that:
</div><ul>
    <li>• You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.”
    </li>
    <li>• You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
        works.
    </li>
    <li>• You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    </li>
    <li>• You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
        distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.
    </li>
</ul><div>
1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.
</div><div>
1.F.
</div><div>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div><div>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div><div>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div><div>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
</div><div>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div><div>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div><div>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div><div>
The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.
</div><div>
The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div><div>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div><div>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div><div>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div><div>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
</div><div>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div><div>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div><div>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
